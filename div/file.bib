  abstract     = {Component-based systems often describe context requirements in terms of explicit inter-component dependencies. Studying large instances of such systems - such as free and open source software (FOSS) distributions - in terms of declared dependencies between packages is appealing. It is however also misleading when the language to express dependencies is as expressive as Boolean formulae, which is often the case. In such settings, a more appropriate notion of component dependency exists: strong dependency. This paper introduces such notion as a first step towards modeling semantic, rather then syntactic, inter-component relationships. Furthermore, a notion of component sensitivity is derived from strong dependencies, with applications to quality assurance and to the evaluation of upgrade risks. An empirical study of strong dependencies and sensitivity is presented, in the context of one of the largest, freely available, component-based system.},

  abstract     = {Lake-level history for Birch Lake, Alaska, was reconstructed using seismic profiles and multiproxy sedimentary analyses including sedimentology, geochemistry, magnetic susceptibility, and palynology. Twenty-two seismic profiles (18 km total) and eight sediment cores taken from the lake margin to its depocenter at 13.5 m provide evidence for low lake stands during the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Thirty-one AMS radiocarbon dates of macrofossils and pollen provide a century-scale chronology. Prior to 12,700 14C yr B.P., the lake, which now overflows, was either seasonally dry or desiccated for prolonged periods, indicating a severe period of aridity. Lake level rose more than 18 m between 12,700 and 12,200 14C yr B.P. before falling to 17 m below the level of overflow. Between 11,600 and 10,600 14C yr B.P. the water remained between 14 and 17 m below the overflow level. Onlap sedimentary sequences were formed during a transgression phase between 10,600 and 10,000 14C yr B.P. Between 10,000 and about 8800 14C yr B.P. the lake was between 6 and 9 m below the overflow level. Lake level again rose, approaching the overflow level, between 8800 and 8000 14C yr B.P. Seismic and core evidence of minor erosional events suggest lowstands of 2--6 m until 4800 14C yr B.P. There have been no prolonged periods of lake-level depression since that time. The major restructuring of the climate system during deglaciation evidently generated a complex set of fluctuations in effective moisture in interior Alaska, which likely affected eolian processes and vegetation development, as well as lake levels.},

Radiocarbon measurements of components of the lacustrine carbon pool imply that the similar to 1000 C-14 yr age of the sediment-water interface results from deposition of C-14-depleted organic matter derived from the water-shed.

  abstract     = {The ice sheet-climate interaction as well as the climatic response to orbital parameters and atmospheric CO2 concentration are examined in order to drive an ice sheet model throughout an ice age cycle. Feedback processes between ice sheet and atmosphere are analyzed by numerical experiments using a high resolution General Circulation Model (GCM) under different conditions at the Last Glacial Maximum. Among the proposed processes, the ice albedo feedback, the elevation-mass balance feedback and the desertification effect over the ice sheet were found to be the dominant processes for the ice-sheet mass balance. For the elevation-mass balance feedback, the temperature lapse rate over the ice sheet is proposed to be weaker than assumed in previous studies. Within the plausible range of parameters related to these processes, the ice sheet response to the orbital parameters and atmospheric CO2 concentration for the last glacial/interglacial cycle was simulated in terms of both ice volume and geographical distribution, using a threedimensional ice-sheet model. Careful treatment of climate ice sheet feedback is essential for a reliable simulation of the ice sheet changes during ice age cycles.},

  abstract      = {We constrain azimuthal anisotropy in the West Antarctic upper mantle using shear wave splitting parameters obtained from teleseismic SKS, SKKS and PKS phases recorded at 37 broad-band seismometres deployed by the POLENET/ANET project. We use an eigenvalue technique to linearize the rotated and shifted shear wave horizontal particle motions and determine the fast direction and delay time for each arrival. High-quality measurements are stacked to determine the best fitting splitting parameters for each station. Overall, fast anisotropic directions are oriented at large angles to the direction of Antarctic absolute plate motion in both hotspot and no-net-rotation frameworks, showing that the anisotropy does not result from shear due to plate motion over the mantle. Further, the West Antarctic directions are substantially different from those of East Antarctica, indicating that anisotropy across the continent reflects multiple mantle regimes. We suggest that the observed anisotropy along the central Transantarctic Mountains (TAM) and adjacent West Antarctic Rift System (WARS), one of the largest zones of extended continental crust on Earth, results from asthenospheric mantle strain associated with the final pulse of western WARS extension in the late Miocene. Strong and consistent anisotropy throughout the WARS indicate fast axes subparallel to the inferred extension direction, a result unlike reports from the East African rift system and rifts within the Basin and Range, which show much greater variation. We contend that ductile shearing rather than magmatic intrusion may have been the controlling mechanism for accumulation and retention of such coherent, widespread anisotropic fabric. Splitting beneath the Marie Byrd Land Dome (MBL) is weaker than that observed elsewhere within the WARS, but shows a consistent fast direction, possibly representative of anisotropy that has been  frozen-in' to remnant thicker lithosphere. Fast directions observed inland from the Amundsen Sea appear to be radial to the dome and may indicate radial horizontal mantle flow associated with an MBL plume head and low upper mantle velocities in this region, or alternatively to lithospheric features associated with the complex Cenozoic tectonics at the far-eastern end of the WARS.},

New tectonic knowledge of the Wilkes Land region of Antarctica allows Australo-Antarctic tectonic linkages to be resolved through reconstruction into ca. 160. Ma Gondwana. We also resolve 330.. 30. km of sinistral strike-slip offset on the {\textgreater} 3000. km long Mundrabilla-Frost Shear Zone and 260. 20. km of dextral offset on the {\textgreater} 1000. km long Aurora Fault to reconstruct the ca. 1150. Ma geometry of Australo-Antarctica. Using this revised geometry, we derive the first model of the Columbia to Gondwana reconfiguration process that is geometrically constrained to {\~{}}. 100. km scale. In this model, early Mesoproterozoic tectonics is driven by two opposing subduction systems. A dominantly west-dipping subduction zone existed at the eastern margin of Australo-Antarctica until ca. 1.55-1.50. Ga. A predominantly east-dipping subduction zone operated at the western margin of the Mawson Craton from ca. 1.70. Ga to ca. 1.42. Ga. The latter caused gradual westwards motion and clockwise rotation of the Mawson Craton relative to the West and North Australian Craton and the accretion of a series of continental ribbons now preserved in the Musgrave Province and its southern extensions. A mid-Mesoproterozoic switch to predominantly west-dipping subduction beneath the West Australian Craton brought about the final closure of the Mawson Craton with the North and West Australian Craton along the Rodona-Totten Shear Zone. Convergence was achieved prior to 1.31. Ga, but final collision may not have occurred until ca. 1.29. Ga. Post-1.29. Ga intraplate activity involved prolonged high-temperature orogenesis from 1.22 to 1.12. Ga, and significant movement on the Mundrabilla-Frost Shear Zone between 1.13 and 1.09. Ga, perhaps in response to the assembly of Rodinia at ca. 1.1. Ga. The Australo-Antarctic Craton was amalgamated with Indo-Antarctica along the Indo-Australo-Antarctic Suture (IAAS) and Kuunga Orogeny, probably in the latest Neoproterozoic to early Cambrian.},

Despite this importance, it remains one of the largest regions on Earth where we lack a basic knowledge of geology. New magnetic, gravity, and subglacial topography data allow the region's first comprehensive geological interpretation. We map lithospheric domains and their bounding faults, including the suture between Indo-Antarctica and Australo-Antarctica. Furthermore, we image subglacial sedimentary basins, including the Aurora and Knox Subglacial Basins and the previously unknown Sabrina Subglacial Basin. Commonality of structure in magnetic, gravity, and topography data suggest that pre-EAIS tectonic features are a primary control on subglacial topography. The preservation of this relationship after glaciation suggests that these tectonic features provide topographic and basal boundary conditions that have strongly influenced the structure and evolution of the EAIS.},

  abstract     = {The study of European and Russian Quaternary glacial-geological evidence during the last 15 years has generated sufficient data to use former glacial extent as a proxy for Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) climate (precipitation and temperature) at a continental scale. Utilisation of such data is relevant for two reasons. First, continental to global scale proxy reconstructions of past climate are an important tool in the assessment of retrospective general circulation model (GCM) simulations. Second, the development of a multiproxy approach will result in a more robust proxy based climate signal. A new and independent dataset of 36 LGM precipitation and temperature relationships derived from European and Russian mountain regions is presented in this paper. A simple glacier-climate model was used to establish the optimum LGM precipitation/temperature conditions for each region from a suite of over 4000 model climates using the principle of zero cumulative mass balance. Clear regional trends are present in the reconstructed LGM precipitation and temperature curves; assuming present precipitation temperature anomalies north of the Alps are 2 degrees C and 5 degrees C larger than those in the western and eastern Mediterranean, respectively. In Russia the model results suggest that the climates in both the Arctic Urals and Puterana Plateau were probably conducive to the existence of small mountain glaciers at the LGM.},

Freshwater fluxes from these ice sheets also may affect oceanic circulation, contributing to climate change.

  abstract     = {Time-domain receiver function modeling (Burdick and Langston, 1977; Langston, 1977, 1979, 1981) was developed to model the shear-wave converted phases and multiples recorded on the horizontal components of P waveforms. Early researchers utilized long-period WWSSN data to construct simple plane- layered models or models containing a few moderately dipping planar inter- faces. Extension to higher frequencies introduced the need for more detailed (thinner layers) models and a linearized time-domain inversion technique (Owens et al., 1984). (For a general review of the receiver function modeling technique, see Langston, 1979; Owens et al., 1984; and Ammon et al., 1990.) In this note, I concentrate on recent developments related to the procedure used to isolate the near-receiver propagation effects from the far-field dislocation time function, near-source structure, lower mantle propagation effects. I begin with a review of Langston's (1979) deconvolution procedure and clear up a recent misinterpretation of the zero-lag arrival on the receiver function as simply a measure of the correlation between the vertical and radial components of motion. This arrival has a physical significance associated with the wave propagation through the simple one-dimensional models assumed in most re- ceiver function studies. I also describe a simple addition to Langston's (1979) equalization technique, which enables an estimate of the absolute amplitude of the receiver function. This absolute amplitude provides an additional constraint on the near-surface velocity structure. Additionally, working with true ampli- tudes illustrates the decrease in the amplitude of the converted phases with increasing source-receiver distance. The true amplitudes are important when estimating the influence of scattering on the receiver function estimates. RECEIVER},

To speed up the waveform inversions, we implement Randali's (1989) efficient algorithms for calculating differential seismograms and include a smoothness constraint on all the resulting velocity models utilizing the "jumping" inversion technique of Shaw and Orcutt (1985). We present the results of more than 235 waveform inversions for one-dimensional velocity structures that indicate that the primary sensitivity of a receiver function is to high wavenumber velocity changes, and a depth-velocity product, not simply velocity. The range of slownesses in a typical receiver function study does not appear to be broad enough to remove the depth-velocity ambiguity; the inclusion of a priori information is necessary. We also present inversion results for station RSCP, located in the Cumberland Plateau, Tennessee. Our results are similar to those from a previous study by Owens et al. (1984) and demonstrate the uncertainties in the resulting velocity estimate more clearly. INTRODUCTION},

Here we present an undisturbed climate record from a North Greenland ice core, which extends back to 123,000 years before the present, within the last interglacial period. The oxygen isotopes in the ice imply that climate was stable during the last interglacial period, with temperatures 5 degrees C warmer than today. We find unexpectedly large temperature differences between our new record from northern Greenland and the undisturbed sections of the cores from central Greenland, suggesting that the extent of ice in the Northern Hemisphere modulated the latitudinal temperature gradients in Greenland. This record shows a slow decline in temperatures that marked the initiation of the last glacial period. Our record reveals a hitherto unrecognized warm period initiated by an abrupt climate warming about 115,000 years ago, before glacial conditions were fully developed. This event does not appear to have an immediate Antarctic counterpart, suggesting that the climate see-saw between the hemispheres (which dominated the last glacial period) was not operating at this time.},

  abstract     = {Throughout Paleocene and Eocene time the Faroe-Shetland Channel and the eastern part of the Faroe Platform was a subsiding marine basin. In Early Paleocene time, basin-floor fans of a British provenance were deposited in the eastern part of the basin. In Late Paleocene time, c. 6 km of basalt entered the basin from the west and north, and the basin was constricted by the large volumes of basalt that entered the basin, creating the Faroe-Shetland Escarpment. In Eocene time subsidence continued in the basinal areas. Again, sediments of a dominantly eastern provenance were deposited. Throughout Eocene time, erosion products from the Faroe Platform were possibly deposited in the Faroe Bank Channel and the Norwegian Sea Basin, but only to a limited degree in the Faroe-Shetland Channel. The oldest sediments of documented western provenance on the eastern margin of the Faroe Platform are of Early Oligocene age. During a compressional phase commencing in Mid-Late Miocene time some basinal areas emerged and erosion took place on the top of emerged anticlines. However, denudation throughout Late Miocene and Early Pliocene time was apparently rather limited compared with a Late Pliocene phase of denudation. During this phase of denudation, a large progradational wedge was deposited on the eastern margin of the Faroe Platform. On the basis of a structural analysis of the Faroe Platform, the amount of basalt removed from it during Cenozoic time is estimated to be c. 46 000 km3 (131 100 x 1012 kg). Using 2900 kg m--3 as the density of basalt and 2300 kg m--3 as sediment density the estimated amount of removed basalt is in fair agreement with the estimate of the volume of sediments derived from the platform (c. 56 000 km3, 114 800 x 1012 kg). The greatest deposition rates on the eastern Faroe Platform and in the Faroe-Shetland Channel apparently occurred after two distinct inversion or compression events in Mid-Eocene and Mid-Late Miocene time. However, uplift of the Faroe Platform could have been forced by denudation rather than endogenous processes.},

However, only the GEOSAT and ERS-1 geodetic mission data recorded more than a decade ago provide altimetry with adequate spatial coverage to derive a high-resolution marine gravity field. The original geodetic mission data suffer from degradation in quality and coverage close to the coast and in Polar Regions as well as the occasionally wrongly retracking of these, even in the open ocean. In order to improve the quality of these geodetic mission data and to derive a new improved global marine gravity field called DNSC08GRA, a new double retracking technique for analyzing the waveform data has been developed. Multiple retracking allows the system to retrack more data to increase the spatial coverage of the data. Subsequently, a second retracking run is used to enhance the SSH determination by using information from the first fitting to inform the second set of retrackers about smoothly varying sea state parameters. The development of the new global marine gravity field DNSC08GRA is described in this paper. Besides application of new retracking techniques the radar altimetry has been processed using EGM2008 as reference and augmented with ArcGP gravity data and laser altimetry from ICESat to close the Polar gap. DNSC08GRA is seen to perform significantly better than previous global marine gravity field like KMS02. The improvement in accuracy is better than 20{\%} in general, but in coastal regions, the improvement is in many places of the order of 40$\backslash\backslash$textendash50{\%} compared to older global marine gravity field KMS02.},

  abstract     = {{\textquotedblleft}Lithosphere{\textquotedblright} is a mechanical concept implying strength and relative permanence. Unfortunately, the term has also been applied to the surface thermal boundary layer (TBL) and a shallow enriched geochemical reservoir, features having nothing to do with strength. The {\textquotedblleft}strong{\textquotedblright} lithosphere is about one half the thickness of the TBL. The bottom of the elastic plate, the maximum depths of midplate and fracture zone earthquakes, and the top of the low-velocity zone all occur at depths corresponding to the 550{$^{\circ}$}--750{$^{\circ}$}C temperature range. This may also correspond to the base of the coherent plate. Earthquakes in subducted slabs are bounded by isotherms in this temperature interval. Mantle hotter than $\sim$650{$^{\circ}$}C cannot support long-term stresses and does not qualify as lithosphere. There is very little ancient lithosphere (mantle colder than 650 $\pm$ 100{$^{\circ}$}C for long periods of time), and this is not a suitable reservoir for continental flood basalts (CFB). A chemical characteristic, that is, {\textquotedblleft}enriched,{\textquotedblright} has been attributed to old lithosphere to distinguish it from the {\textquotedblleft}depleted{\textquotedblright} upper mantle. The continental lithosphere (CL) is often treated as a viable reservoir for CFB or, when delaminated, for ocean island basalts and enriched mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB). The CFB reservoir is more likely to be a hot, weak sublithospheric layer which may include the lower part of the TBL. The term {\textquotedblleft}perisphere{\textquotedblright} has been introduced to accommodate the need for a term for a global, shallow, enriched reservoir or boundary layer. It is physically isolated from the depleted mantle (usually called the {\textquotedblleft}convecting mantle,{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}asthenosphere{\textquotedblright} or {\textquotedblleft}upper mantle{\textquotedblright}) not by its strength but by its weakness and buoyancy; it is chemically isolated by its location relative to subduction recycling. It has the chemical characteristics often attributed to continental lithosphere (or plume heads), but it is a permanent part of the sublithospheric shallow mantle and is constantly refreshed by recycling. It is an open system and can also be called the {\textquotedblleft}active layer{\textquotedblright} or {\textquotedblleft}mixing zone.{\textquotedblright} It is proposed that the depleted reservoir (MORB source or depleted mantle) is below and protected from contamination (chemical isolation) by the filtering action of this boundary layer. Depleted MORB is most prominent at fast spreading ridges, which induce or localize deep, broad upwellings. Melts from enriched mantle (EM) are most evident at new or slowly rifting regions, infant subduction zones, new backarc basins, slab windows, and mid-plate environments away from spreading induced upwelling. EM is therefore probably shallow. It is not known if volatiles and large-ion lithophiles can recycle much deeper than $\sim$200 km, or into the lower mantle, as is implied by some plume theories. The base of the (strong) lithosphere and plate may correspond to a phase change. If so, the correspondence among the brittle-ductile boundary (the maximum depth of earthquakes), the top of the low-velocity zone, and the elastic plate thickness can be understood. Candidate phase changes include dehydration and clinoenstatite to orthoenstatite since these occur near 600{$^{\circ}$}C. Another rheological boundary may set in near the solidus, but silicates lose most of their strength at absolute temperatures about one half the dry solidus temperature. The region of the subcontinental mantle between $\sim$600{$^{\circ}$}C and the solidus may provide some of the material in continental magmas, but this cannot be considered part of the continental plate. The {\textquotedblleft}continental lithosphere{\textquotedblright} reservoir of petrologists is actually a weak enriched layer that may spread across the top of the convecting mantle. This is the perisphere. Its existence makes it possible to understand CFB and ocean island chemistry and kinematics without postulating plumes from the lower mantle, plume heads, fossil plume heads, or delaminated CL. The upper mantle is inhomogeneous in chemistry.},

Temperature measurements can be analyzed for recharge and discharge rates, the effects of surface warming, interchange with surface water, hydraulic conductivity of streambed sediments, and basin-scale permeability. Temperature data are also used in formal solutions of the inverse problem to estimate ground water flow and hydraulic conductivity. The fundamentals of using heat as a ground water tracer were published in the 1960s, but recent work has significantly expanded the application to a variety of hydrogeological settings. In recent work, temperature is used to delineate flows in the hyporheic zone, estimate submarine ground water discharge and depth to the salt-water interface, and in parameter estimation with coupled ground water and heat-flow models. While short reviews of selected work on heat as a ground water tracer can be found in a number of research papers, there is no critical synthesis of the larger body of work found in the hydrogeological literature. The purpose of this review paper is to fill that void and to show that ground water temperature data and associated analytical tools are currently underused and have not yet realized their full potential.},

The ice core records primarily reflect hemispheric temperature-related climate processes whereas lakes tend to reflect regional scale climatic variability. Stable isotopes in closed-basin lakes are sensitive to changes in effective precipitation. Here we report stable isotope evidence (??18O and ??13C records from authigenic calcite in laminated lake sediments) from two oligosaline, closed-basin lakes in southern West Greenland (S??ndre Str??mfjord). The stable isotope profiles indicate a dynamic early to mid-Holocene climate as a strongly negative precipitation-evaporation balance from ???7000 to 5600calyr BP lowered lake levels throughout the region. This interpretation of the stable isotope data is supported by a survey of modern lake-water isotopic composition and fossil shorelines around many closed-basin saline lakes which indicate higher lake levels in the past. The increased aridity during the early Holocene resulted from a shift in regional circulation patterns in the Davis Straits-Baffin Bay area. Enhanced stability of the West Greenland depression and the situation of a regional trough over the S??ndre Str??mfjord area caused weakened westerly airflow and strengthened outflow (i.e. winds blowing off the ice sheet), resulting in reduced precipitation in the region. Decreased precipitation, coupled with higher insolation, probably caused the negative precipitation-evaporation balance. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In situ cosmogenic 14C in rock surfaces, and 14C in plant macrofossils from lake-sediment cores demonstrate that the plateau remained ice-free through the middle Holocene, but has supported ice caps for more than 2000 of the past 2800 years. The rapid disappearance of these ice caps over the past century, despite decreasing summer insolation, further demonstrates the unusual character of 20\textsuperscript{th} Century warmth. Widespread ice-cap expansion $\sim$1280 AD early in the Little Ice Age, and intensified expansion $\sim$1450 AD, coincide with peak stratospheric volcanic aerosol loading and reduced solar luminosity, suggesting that these mechanisms may have initiated ice-cap growth, subsequently maintained by strong positive feedbacks.},

Field mapping, soil profile development and 14C dating reveal the existence of at least two generations of raised beach deposits. Well-developed raised beaches rise to the Late Weichselian marine limit at 36 m a.s.l. Discontinuous pre-Late Weichselian beach deposits rise from the Late Weichselian marine limit to approximately 65 m a.s.l. Expansion of local glaciers in the area during the Late Weichselian is indicated by a till that locally overlies pre-Late Weichselian raised beach deposits. Stratigraphic data from coastal sections reveal two shallow marine units deposited during part of oxygen isotope stage 5. The two shallow marine units are separated by a subglacially deposited till that indicates an ice advance from Prins Karls Forland into the Forlandsundet basin some time during the latter part of stage 5. Discontinuous glaciofluvial deposits and a cobble-boulder lag could relate to a Late Weichselian local glacial advance across the coastal site. Late Weichselian/early Holocene beach deposits cap the sedimentary succession. Palaeotemperature estimates derived from amino acid ratios in subfossil marine molluscs indicate that the area has not been submerged or covered by warm based glacier ice for significant periods of time during the time interval ca. 70 ka to 10 ka.},

  abstract     = {Subduction zones are where sediments, oceanic crust, and mantle lithosphere return to and reequilibrate with Earth's mantle. Subduction zones are interior expressions of Earth's 55,000 km of convergent plate margins and are the geodynamic system that builds island arcs. Excess density of the mantle lithosphere in subduction zones provides most of the power needed to move the plates while inducing convection in the overriding mantle wedge. Asthenospheric mantle sucked toward the trench by the sinking slab interacts with water and incompatible elements rising from the sinking plate, and this interaction causes the mantle to melt. These melts rise vertically through downwelling mantle to erupt at arc volcanoes. Subduction zones are thus interior Earth systems of unparalleled scale and complexity. Subduction zone igneous activity formed most ore deposits and continental crust, and earthquakes caused by the downgoing plate present a growing hazard to society. This overview summarizes our present understanding of subduction zones, using perspectives of the incoming plate, downgoing plate, mantle wedge, and arc-trench complex. Understanding the operation of subduction zones stands as one of the great challenges facing the Earth sciences in the 21\textsuperscript{st} century and will require the efforts of global interdisciplinary teams.},

We have used such techniques to image the geomorphology of the SW Barents Sea, but using a dense grid of 2D seismic, covering a 240 0002??km large study area, supplemented with 3D seismic from selected areas. The study area is located at the convergence of ice flow from the former Fennoscandian, Barents Sea and Svalbard ice sheets. The morphology of the major cross-shelf troughs is characterized by elongated ridge-groove features, interpreted to be glacial bedforms produced by fast-flowing grounded glaciers. Mega-scale glacial lineations have been grouped into distinct flow sets related to three specific ice flow events. These events document the last glacial maximum (LGM) and two readvances during deglaciation. Of specific interest is a detailed and well-preserved set of seafloor imprints in the Bj??rn??yrenna trough, which acted as the main pathway for ice streams draining the surrounding ice sheets. The geomorphic features indicate that Bj??rn??yrenna hosted six separate ice stream lobes that diverged fan-like at their margins, but were not all active simultaneously. An end moraine zone 68??km wide, up to 85??m high and 300??km long filled the whole width of this major glacial trough as a result of high sediment flux within sub-ice stream deformable beds. The imprint of this ice stream system can be followed on our seabed images for 500??km; however, detailed geomorphologic elements demonstrate that these imprints reflect time-transgressive behaviour and do not indicate the length or width of single ice streams. The seismic-derived seafloor geomorphology demonstrates that the Barents Sea ice behaved in a much more dynamic way during the last glaciation than previously assumed, with major shifts between ice originating from the Fennoscandian, Spitsbergen and Barents Sea ice sheets. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The 3D seismic data have relatively low-frequency content ({\textless}40 Hz) but, due to dense spatial sampling, long source-receiver offsets, 3D migration and advanced interpretation techniques, they provide surprisingly detailed images of inferred gas accumulations and the sedimentary environments in which they occur. The presence of gas is inferred from seismic reflection segments with anomalously high amplitude and reversed phase, compared with the seafloor reflection, so-called bright spots. Fluid migration is inferred from vertical zones of acoustic masking and acoustic pipes. The 3D seismic volume allows a spatial analysis of amplitude anomalies inferred to reflect the presence of gas and fluids. At several locations, seismic attribute maps reveal detailed images of flat spots, inferred to represent gas--water interfaces. The data indicate a focused fluid migration system, where sub-vertical faults and zones of highly fractured sediments are conduits for the migration of gas-bearing fluids in Plio-Pleistocene sediments. Gas is interpreted to appear in high-porosity fan-shaped sediment lobes, channel and delta deposits, glacigenic debris flows and sediment blocks, probably sealed by low-permeability, clayey till and/or (glacio)marine sediments. Gas and fluid flow are here attributed mainly to rapid Plio-Pleistocene sedimentation that loaded large amounts of sedimentary material over lower-density, fine-grained Eocene oozes. This probably caused pore-fluid dewatering of the high-fluid content oozes through a network of polygonal faults. The study area is suggested to have experienced cycles of fluid expulsion and hydrocarbon migration associated with glacial--interglacial cycles.},

  abstract     = {In the last several years evidence has mounted that a series of abrupt changes in sediment delivery and palaeoceanography effected the North Atlantic; they are recorded in a variety of proxy records but most dramatically in changes of grain-size and mineralogy associated with postulated iceberg rafting events, specifically Heinrich (H) events. This review paper examines the evidence for such evidence prior to the development of the {\textquoteleft}Heinrich event' concept (1988--1992), and then examines the explosion of data and correlations that stemmed from the acceptance and use of this paradigm. Specific attention is focused on ideas pertaining to the cause(s) of glaciological mechanisms, sediment delivery, and sediment source, and major gaps in our understanding of the underlying glaciological, glacial geological, and glacial marine processes are stressed. Abrupt changes across boundaries associated with H-2 in the Labrador Sea are illustrated from core HU87033-009LCF. The case is made that correlations between records need to be more rigorous, especially within the range of radiocarbon dating, but it appears that abrupt changes in the delivery of iceberg rafted debris, which characterize these intervals, are multisourced. It is unclear how global {\textquoteleft}climate' can simultaneously influence the abrupt behaviour of ice margins in different parts of the world---for marine-based margins, changes in relative sea-level are one possibility. A qualitative model is presented for triggering H events, which includes global changes in mass balance, changes in relative sea-level at ice margins due to glacial isostasy, and changes in the basal thermal regime of tidewater ice-streams. {\textcopyright} 1998 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

The radiocarbon dates were obtained on samples from the basal part of sediment cores collected across an area between 64 and 67{$^{\circ}$}N and 18-29{$^{\circ}$}W. Core sites were based on 3.5 kHz acoustic subbottom surveys. The 3.5 kHz subbottom profiles indicate that several of the troughs contain $\geq$ 30 m of Quaternary sediment. At many sites, the acoustic surveys suggest the presence of one or more strong reflectors which can be traced over extended areas ({\textgreater} 100 km) of the seafloor. These may represent large-scale volcanic ash falls, such as the Vedde ash and its correlatives, as well as other regionally significant tephras. We report dates from seven areas; (1) Northern troughs - Eyjafjardarall, Hunafloadjup, and Reykjafjardarall: (2) Hunafloi area and inner shelf and fjords; (3) Djupall area; (4) Isafjardardjup area; (5) Kolluall; (6) western shelf break and slope; and (7) Jokuldjup. The dates range in age from Marine Isotope Stages 3-1. Five cores have basal dates $\geq$ 16 ka and thus provide information on the timing and environments during the deglaciation. Several dates of {\~{}} 12 ka indicate that the inner shelf may have been largely ice-free by that time.

  abstract     = {The topographic evolution of the "passive" margins of the North Atlantic during the last 65??Myr is the subject of extensive debate due to inherent limitations of the geological, geomorphological and geophysical methods used for studies of uplift and subsidence. We have compiled a database of sign, time and amplitude (where possible) of topographic changes in the North Atlantic region during the Cenozoic (65-0??Ma). Our compilation is based on published results from reflection seismic studies, AFT (apatite fission track) studies, VR (vitrinite reflectance) trends, maximum burial, sediment supply studies, mass balance calculations and extrapolation of seismic profiles to onshore geomorphological features. The integration of about 200 published results reveal a clear pattern of topographic changes in the North Atlantic region during the Cenozoic: (1) The first major phase of Cenozoic regional uplift occurred in the late Palaeocene-early Eocene (ca 60-50??Ma), probably related to the break-up of the North Atlantic between Europe and Greenland, as indicated by the northward propagation of uplift. It was preceded by middle Palaeocene uplift and over-deepening of some basins of the North Sea and the surrounding areas. (2) A regional increase in subsidence in the offshore marginal areas of Norway, the northern North Sea, the northern British Isles and west Greenland took place in the Eocene (ca 57-35??Ma). (3) The Oligocene and Miocene (35-5??Ma) were characterized by regional tectonic quiescence, with only localised uplift, probably related to changes in plate dynamics. (4) The second major phase of regional uplift that affected all marginal areas of the North Atlantic occurred in the Plio-Pleistocene (5-0??Ma). Its amplitude was enhanced by erosion-driven glacio-isostatic compensation. Despite inconclusive evidence, this phase is likely to be ongoing at present. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

At four sites the sedimentation rates were relatively uniform, and in consequence the 210Pb dates were relatively unambiguous. At the remaining sites there were irregularities in the 210Pb activity versus depth profiles, indicating significant variations in the net sediment accumulation rate during the past 120 years. At these sites, there were significant differences between 210Pb dates calculated using the two standard simple dating models, constant rate of supply (CRS) and constant initial concentration (CIC). In most cases, stratigraphic dates based on the 137Cs and 241Am records supported use of the CRS model, though at one site (Ossian Sarsfjellet) the CIC model appeared more appropriate. The irregularities in the 210Pb records were mainly caused by episodes of accelerated sedimentation due, for example, to inwash or slump events, though at some sites there appears to have been a systematic increase in sediment accumulation rates in recent decades. Sediment accumulation rates were generally lower at the northern sites, and higher at the more southerly locations. Mean sediment accumulation rates varied by an order of magnitude, ranging from 0.002 to 0.050 g cm$-$2 y$-$1 (0.02--0.10 cm y$-$1). 210Pb fluxes measured from the core inventories were mostly in the range 34--80 Bq m$-$2 y$-$1 typical of Arctic sites. Much higher values, recorded at two sites (Birgervatnet and Daltj{\o}rna), may be due to significant inputs from the catchments during spring thaw.},

Because K acts as a volatile species during accretion, the K content of the silicate Earth is determined as a function of the terrestrial K/U ratio. A comprehensive examination of MORB from the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, including both normal- and enriched-type samples, reveals a composite MORB source K/U ratio of 19,000 ?? 2600 (2??). In comparison, ocean island basalts and average continental crust have average K/U values of 11,900 ?? 2200 and 13,000 ?? 3000, respectively. The fractional contributions of these reservoirs establishes the K/U ratio of the silicate Earth to be 13,800 ?? 2600 (2??), equating to 280 ?? 120????g/g K in the silicate Earth. As a result, the planet's convective Urey ratio is verified to be {\~{}} 0.34, which indicates a current mantle cooling rate of 70-130??K Gyr- 1 after taking into account potential heat flux across the core-mantle boundary. Additionally, the Earth's balance of radiogenic heat flow and budget of 40Ar necessitate a lower mantle reservoir enriched in radioactive elements.

  abstract     = {This paper reports a new 1 x 1 global thermal model for the continental lithosphere (TC1). Geotherms for continental terranes of different ages ({\textgreater}3.6 Ga to present) constrained by reliable data on borehole heat flow measurements (Artemieva, I.M., Mooney, W.D. 2001. Thermal structure and evolution of Precambrian lithosphere: a global study. J. Geophys. Res 106, 16387-16414.), are statistically analyzed as a function of age and are used to estimate lithospheric temperatures in continental regions with no or low-quality heat flow data (ca. 60{\%} of the continents). These data are supplemented by cratonic geotherms based on electromagnetic and xenolith data; the latter indicate the existence of Archean cratons with two characteristic thicknesses, ca. 200 and {\textgreater}250 km. A map of tectono-thermal ages of lithospheric terranes complied for the continents on a 1?? ?? 1?? grid and combined with the statistical age relationship of continental geotherms (z=0.04* t+93.6, where z is lithospheric thermal thickness in km and t is age in Ma) formed the basis for a new global thermal model of the continental lithosphere (TC1). The TC1 model is presented by a set of maps, which show significant thermal heterogeneity within continental upper mantle, with the strongest lateral temperature variations (as large as 800 ??C) in the shallow mantle. A map of the depth to a 550 ??C isotherm (Curie isotherm for magnetite) in continental upper mantle is presented as a proxy to the thickness of the magnetic crust; the same map provides a rough estimate of elastic thickness of old ({\textgreater}200 Ma) continental lithosphere, in which flexural rigidity is dominated by olivine rheology of the mantle. Statistical analysis of continental geotherms reveals that thick ({\textgreater}250 km) lithosphere is restricted solely to young Archean terranes (3.0-2.6 Ga), while in old Archean cratons (3.6-3.0 Ga) lithospheric roots do not extend deeper than 200-220 km. It is proposed that the former were formed by tectonic stacking and underplating during paleocollision of continental nuclei; it is likely that such exceptionally thick lithospheric roots have a limited lateral extent and are restricted to paleoterrane boundaries. This conclusion is supported by an analysis of the growth rate of the lithosphere since the Archean, which does not reveal a peak in lithospheric volume at 2.7-2.6 Ga as expected from growth curves for juvenile crust. A pronounced peak in the rate of lithospheric growth (10-18 km3/year) at 2.1-1.7 Ga (as compared to 5-8 km3/ year in the Archean) well correlates with a peak in the growth of juvenile crust and with a consequent global extraction of massif-type anorthosites. It is proposed that large-scale variations in lithospheric thickness at cratonic margins and at paleoterrane boundaries controlled anorogenic magmatism. In particular, mid-Proterozoic anorogenic magmatism at the cratonic margins was caused by edge-driven convection triggered by a fast growth of the lithospheric mantle at 2.1-1.7 Ga. Belts of anorogenic magmatism within cratonic interiors can be caused by a deflection of mantle heat by a locally thickened lithosphere at paleosutures and, thus, can be surface manifestations of exceptionally thick lithospheric roots. The present volume of continental lithosphere as estimated from the new global map of lithospheric thermal thickness is 27.8 (??7.0) ?? 109 km3 (excluding submerged terranes with continental crust); preserved continental crust comprises ca. 7.7 ?? 109 km3. About 50{\%} of the present continental lithosphere existed by 1.8 Ga. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal of Geophysical Research 106, 16387-16414.] show strong correlation with tectono-thermal ages and with regional variations in lithospheric thickness constrained by surface heat flow data and seismic velocities. In agreement with xenolith data, strong positive velocity anomalies of non-thermal origin (attributed to mantle depletion) are clearly seen for all of the cratons; their amplitude, however, varies laterally and decreases with depth, reflecting either a peripheral growth of the cratons in Proterozoic or their peripheral reworking. These cratonic regions where kimberlite magmas erupted show only weakly positive compositional velocity anomalies, atypical for the "intact" cratonic mantle. A reduction in the amplitude of compositional velocity anomalies in kimberlite provinces is interpreted to result from metasomatic enrichment (prior or during kimberlite emplacement) of the cratonic mantle, implying that xenolith data maybe non-representative of the "intact" cratonic mantle. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {An overview of seismic, thermal, and petrological evidence on the structure of Precambrian lithosphere suggests that its local maximum thickness is highly variable (140-350 km), with a bimodal distribution for Archean cratons (200-220 km and 300-350 km). We discuss the origin of such large differences in lithospheric thickness, and propose that the lithospheric base can have large depth variations over short distances. The topography of Bryce Canyon (western USA) is proposed as an inverted analog of the base of the lithosphere. The horizontal and vertical dimensions of Archean cratons are strongly correlated: larger cratons have thicker lithosphere. Analysis of the bimodal distribution of lithospheric thickness in Archean cratons shows that the "critical" surface area for cratons to have thick ({\textgreater}300 km) keels is {\textgreater}6-8 $\times$ 106 km2 . Extrapolation of the linear trend between Archean lithospheric thickness and cratonic area to zero area yields a thickness of 180 km. This implies that the reworking of Archean crust should be accompanied by thinning and reworking of the entire lithospheric column to a thickness of 180 km in accord with thickness estimates for Proterozoic lithosphere. Likewise, extrapolation of the same trend to the size equal to the total area of all Archean cratons implies that the lithospheric thickness of a hypothesized early Archean supercontinent could have been 350-450 km decreasing to 280-400 km for Gondwanaland. We evaluate the basal drag model as a possible mechanism that may thin the cratonic lithosphere. Inverse correlations are found between lithospheric thickness and (a) fractional subduction length and (b) the effective ridge length. In agreement with theoretical predictions, lithospheric thickness of Archean keels is proportional to the square root of the ratio of the craton length (along the direction of plate motion) to the plate velocity. Large cratons with thick keels and low plate velocities are less eroded by basal drag than small fast-moving cratons. Basal drag may have varied in magnitude over the past 4 Ga. Higher mantle temperatures in the Archean would have resulted in lower mantle viscosity. This in turn would have reduced basal drag and basal erosion, and promoted the preservation of thick ({\textgreater}300 km) Archean keels, even if plate velocities were high during the Archean. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Although, the general features of this millennial-scale sea-level records have strong similarities to the rather symmetric and gradual Southern Hemisphere climate patterns, we observe, in constrast to previous findings, pronounced sea level rises of up to 25 m to generally correspond with Northern Hemisphere warmings as recorded in Greenland ice-core interstadial intervals whereas sea-level lowstands mostly occur during cold phases. Corroborated by CLIMBER-2 model results, the close connection of millennial-scale sea-level changes to Northern Hemisphere temperature variations indicates a primary climatic control on the mass balance of the major Northern Hemisphere ice sheets and does not require a considerable Antarctic contribution. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract     = {This paper summarizes the principal results produced by the European Science Foundation's programme, Quaternary Environment of the Eurasian North (QUEEN). These results concern the distribution of late Quaternary glaciers of different ages across northern Eurasia. The pattern of glaciation is compared with the west--east climatic gradient of the continent. Of particular significance is the coincidence of the Late Weichselian ice margin with the modern 30{$^{\circ}$}C difference between the July and January mean air temperatures. The differ- ence between west and east in the annual amplitude of air temperature did not decrease during the Pleniglacial. The asymmetry of the glacial history suggests a progressive aridification of the Eurasian North, with the result that by marine isotope stage 2 significant ice volumes could only accumulate along the Atlan- tic seaboard. The different climatic signals of thermochrons and cryochrons of the extreme west and east of the continent are discussed. The growth of continentality eastwards restrains the applicability of pollen proxies for climatic reconstructions. At},

The bulk of evidence indicates that Arctic and Subarctic regions of European Russia, of western and central Siberia during the Middle Pleistocene were at least 4 times covered by large ice sheets, which advanced mainly from the shelf ice domes, partly from Fennoscandia and the Putorana Plateau. Ice accumulations in the Ural Mountains were insignificant and did not form any noticeable ice dispersal centres. Unlike the classical glaciated areas, ice sheets of northern Russia acted mainly on a soft, perennially frozen substrate, which was heavily glacitectonised. The Middle Pleistocene ice sheets were much larger than the Weichselian ones. The Fennoscandian ice dispersal centre was most active in northern European Russia during the penultimate glaciation (OIS 6) when shelf-centred ice domes were relatively weaker. Larger continental ice sheets were formed in preceding ice ages, when Kara Sea ice dispersal centre dominated. The lowland ice sheets reached their maximum extent at different stages, from Cromerian Don glaciation in European Russia to OIS 8 in West Siberia. Therefore, the maximum ice limit is time-transgressive in northern Russia. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Over 200 finite radiocarbon dates have been analysed. 77{\%} of the entire population represent sediments overlying the topmost till, including dating the most reliable organics such as mammoth remains. The rest of the dates (23{\%}) have been obtained from the underlying sediments, mostly on materials readily prone to redeposition and contamination such as driftwood and shells. The last culmination of the shelf ice sheet must have occurred beyond the range of the conventional radiocarbon method and after the last warm-water sea transgression correlative to the Eemian. The Early Weichselian age for the last Kara Sea ice sheet is also supported by the lack of proglacial lacustrine sediments with finite radiocarbon dates in periglacial West Siberia.},

The original meaning and subsequent distortions of the Siberian stratigraphic terms Zyryanka, Karginsky, Sartan and others are described. Stratigraphic schemes traditionally used in Siberia and in the Russian European Arctic contain similar mistakes due to poor sedimentology obtained from simplistic log descriptions. Indiscriminate use of radiocarbon dating, in disregard to the sedimentological complications, have eroded the value of the old stratigraphic terms and depleted their usefulness. Modern data on widespread glaciotectonic activity and redeposition of organics by shelf-based ice sheets, on retarded melting of buried glacial ice, on ubiquitous permafrost and aeolian processes, coupled with new geochronometric results make it impossible to employ the old framework based on the presumption of undisturbed stratification and slow unperturbed sedimentation. A more structurally complicated model, to which traditional stratigraphic labels are not applicable, is suggested for the uppermost sedimentary formations of arctic plains. It is derived from a wider view of the glacigenic complex by lateral tracing of study objects as a necessary complement to conventional log descriptions. The old Siberian stratigraphic scheme, being obsolete and misleading, is not recommended for further use. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {The geological structure of one of the southernmost sites of thick ice beds in the Yenisei valley near the Arctic Circle is discussed. The erosion contacts of the foliated and contorted ice, abundance of glacial debris and the position between the basal till and ablation cover indicate a glacial origin for the ice layer. The ice occurs in the cores of arcuate accretion ridges built of ablation materials. The overlying sequence consists of a series of diamicton flows alternating with lacustrine and outwash sediments. Laterally the ice-rock complex changes into thick lacustrine rhythmites underlain by basal tills. The ice-containing hummocky terrain is often lower than the adjacent lacustrine plain. Therefore inversion of ice-controlled topography is suggested. Several stages of glaciokarst development are supposed to have occurred after an eastward moving ice lobe stagnated more than 50 ka BP. The main depositional events are associated with the Middle Weichselian draining of ice-dammed Lake Igarka, and with Early Holocene topographic inversion. The Holocene warming apparently caused diapiric deformation of the buried ice probably because of the density and thickness differences between the ice and the overburden. The long history of burial and preservation of the remnants of basal glacier ice was controlled by Pleistocene permafrost. Landscape evolution in Northern Siberia is governed by such 'retarded deglaciation', in contrast with Atlantic environments. The thick ablation sequence may be described in terms of a Spitsbergen model, but the Siberian basal tills, because of their position within the permafrost, must be regarded as exfoliated layers of debris-rich ice according to Shantzer-Lavrushin's model. The occurrence of buried glacier ice and the mode of distribution of the permafrost shows the relict nature of the latter. In areas of modern and former retarded deglaciation intermittent diamicton flows are supposed to mark episodes of climatic amelioration like the Pleistocene and Holocene diamictons with driftwood at the 'Ice Hill'. Such 'warm' diamictons may account for some Early Holocene and similar puzzling interglacial 'ice advances'. ?? 1988.},

Ductile deformations such as folds and diapirs are also widespread. The mode of deformation of frozen subglacial sediments is dependent on their lithology, ice content and temperature conditions.

  abstract     = {Glacial landforms in northern Russia, from the Timan Ridge in the west to the east of the Urals, have been mapped by aerial photographs and satellite images supported by field observations. An east-west trending belt of fresh hummock-and-lake glaciokarst landscapes has been traced to the north of 67 degrees N. The southern boundary of these landscapes is called the Markhida Line, which is interpreted as a nearly synchronous limit of the last ice sheet that affected this region. The hummocky landscapes are subdivided into three types according to the stage of postglacial modification: Markhida, Harbei and Halmer. The Halmer landscape on the Uralian piedmont in the east is the freshest, whereas the westernmost Markhida landscape is more eroded. The west-east gradient in morphology is considered to be a result of the time-transgressive melting of stagnant glacier ice and of the underlying permafrost. The pattern of ice-pushed ridges and other directional features reflects a dominant ice flow direction from the Kara Sea shelf. Traces of ice movement from the central Barents Sea are only discernible in the Pechora River left bank area west of 50 degrees E. In the Polar Urals the horseshoe-shaped end moraines at altitudes of up to 560 m a.s.l. reflect ice movement up-valley from the Kara Ice Sheet, indicating the absence of a contemporaneous ice dome in the mountains. The Markhida moraines, superimposed onto the Eemian strata, represent the maximum ice sheet extent in the western part of the Pechora Basin during the Weichselian. The Markhida Line truncates the huge arcs of the Laya-Adzva and Rogovaya ice-pushed ridges protruding to the south. The latter moraines therefore reflect an older ice advance, probably also of Weichselian age. Still farther south, fluvially dissected morainic plateaus without lakes are of pre-Eemian age, because they plunge northwards under marine Eemian sediments. Shorelines of the large ice-dammed Lake Komi, identified between 90 and 110 m a.s.l. in the areas south of the Markhida Line, are radiocarbon dated to be older than 45 ka. The shorelines, incised into the Laya-Adzva moraines, morphologically interfinger with the Markhida moraines, indicating that the last ice advance onto the Russian mainland reached the Markhida Line during the Middle or Early Weichselian, before 45 ka ago.},

Recovered samples were thinned to electron transparency by focused ion beam and characterized by analytical transmission electron microscopy (ATEM) and nanometer-scale secondary ion mass spectroscopy (nanoSIMS). Iron concentrations in both phases were obtained from X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy measurements and nanoSIMS. Our results are the first to show that recently reported spin-state and phase transitions in the lower mantle directly affect the evolution of Fe-Mg exchange between both phases. Mg-perovskite becomes increasingly iron-depleted above 70-80??GPa possibly due to the high spin-low spin transition of iron in ferropericlase. Conversely, the perovskite to post-perovskite transition is accompanied by a strong iron enrichment of the silicate phase, ferropericlase remaining in the Fe-rich phase though. Nanoparticles of metallic iron were observed in the perovskite-bearing runs, suggesting the disproportionation of ferrous iron oxide, but were not observed when the post-perovskite phase was present. Implications on the oxidation state of the Earth and core segregation will be discussed. Transition trace-element (Ni, Mn) concentrations (determined with the nanoSIMS) show similar trends and could thus be used to trace the origin of diamonds generated at depth. This study provides new results likely to improve the geochemical and geophysical models of the Earth's deep interiors. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {A continuous record of insect (Chironomidae) remains preserved in lake sediments is used to infer temperature changes at a small lake in Arctic Canada through the Holocene. Early Holocene summers at the study site were characterized by more thermophilous assemblages and warmer inferred temperatures than today, presumably in response to the positive anomaly in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. Peak early Holocene warmth was interrupted by two cold reversals between 9.5 and 8??cal ka BP, during which multiple cold-stenothermous chironomid taxa appeared in the lake. The earlier reversal appears to correlate with widespread climate anomalies around 9.2??cal ka BP; the age of the younger reversal is equivocal but it may correlate with the 8.2 cal ka BP cold event documented elsewhere. Widespread, abrupt climate shifts in the early Holocene illustrate the susceptibility of the climate system to perturbations, even during periods of enhanced warmth in the Northern Hemisphere. ?? 2008 University of Washington.},

  abstract     = {Equilibrium-line altitudes (ELAs) were estimated for 383 reconstructed glaciers across the Brooks Range, northern Alaska, to investigate their regional pattern during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Glacier outlines were delimited based on published field mapping and the original interpretations of aerial photographs. Glacier margins were digitised from 1:63 360-scale maps into a geographic information system (GIS) with a digital elevation model on a 60-m grid. ELAs were calculated for each reconstructed glacier using the accumulation area ratio method (AAR = 0.58). The analysis was restricted to relatively simple cirque and valley glaciers that deposited clearly identifiable LGM moraines, and that did not merge with the complex transection glacier ice that filled most troughs of the range. The glaciers used in this analysis had areas ranging from 0.14 to 120 km(2). Their ELAs rose from 470 m a.s.l. in the western Brooks Range to 1860 m a.s.l. in the east, over a distance of 1000 km. The ELAs were fitted with a third-order polynomial trend Surface to model their distribution across the range, and to investigate the Source of local-scale variations. The trend Surface lowers toward the west and South, similar to previously derived trends based on glaciation thresholds. In addition, ELAs in the northeastern part of the range lower northward toward the Beaufort Sea, which has not been reported as strongly in other studies. Modern glacier ELAs also lower toward the Southwest. The depression of LGM ELAs from modern glacier ELAs is greatest in the central Brooks Range (a maximum of 700 m), and decreases to the east (200 m). The regional pattern of LGM ELAs points to the primary Source of moisture from the North Pacific, as it is today. The unexpected trend of LGM ELAs in the northeast part of the range is Supported by recent field mapping, where anomalous ice distribution and ELAs reflect complicated LGM climate patterns and possibly late Quaternary tectonism.

The lower has been interpreted as a periglacial trimline marking the upper limits of Loch Lomond (Younger Dryas) Stade glaciers, and has been employed to reconstruct the dimensions of parts of the main West Highland icefield and certain smaller glaciers and icefields. Interpretation of the upper weathering limit has been more contentious, but recent research has demonstrated: (1) significant contrasts in the degree of bedrock weathering above and below this limit; (2) that gibbsite, a pre-Devensian weathering product, is abundant above the limit but rare in soils farther downslope; (3) that the isotopic (Al-26) age of bedrock exposures above the limit greatly exceeds that at lower altitudes; and (4) that the altitude of the weathering limit descends regularly along former ice-sheet flowlines. Collectively, these attributes suggest that the upper weathering limit is a periglacial trimline defining the maximum altitude of the last ice sheet. Calculated basal shear stress values are consistent with this interpretation, which implies that the mainland ice-shed lay at ca. 900 m in Wester Ross and descended greatly northwards, whilst Harris and Lewis in the Outer Hebrides supported an independent ice-cap that achieved a maximum altitude of ca. 700 m. Wider implications of this interpretation and the future potential for ice-sheet reconstruction are explored. Copyright (C) 1996 INQUA/Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract     = {Paraglacial geomorphology is the study of earth-surface processes, sediments, landforms, landsystems and landscapes that are directly conditioned by former glaciation and deglaciation. The withdrawal of glacier ice exposes landscapes that are in an unstable or metastable state, and consequently liable to modification, erosion and sediment release at rates greatly exceeding background denudation rates. This paper (1) reviews research on paraglacial processes, landforms and landscape change in a range of geomorphological settings; (2) explores the importance of paraglacial landscape modification and sediment recycling as a component of alternating glacial/nonglacial landscape evolution; (3) assesses the nature and significance of paraglacial facies in Quaternary stratigraphic sequences; and (4) develops a general model of the sequence of paraglacial landscape modification and the changing nature of paraglacial landsystems. Six paraglacial landsystems are identified: rock slopes, drift-mantled slopes, glacier forelands, and alluvial, lacustrine and coastal systems. Each contains a wide range of paraglacial landforms and sediment facies. Collectively these landforms and sediments (e.g. talus accumulations, debris cones, alluvial fans, valley fills, deltas and coastal barrier structures) can be conceptualised as storage components of an interrupted sediment cascade with four primary sources (rockwalls, drift-mantled slopes, valley-floor glacigenic deposits and coastal glacigenic deposits) and four terminal sediment sinks (alluvial valley-fill deposits, lacustrine deposits, coastal/nearshore deposits and shelf/offshore deposits). Paraglacial sediment stores and sinks may form major sources of readily erodible sediment during the early stages of glacial cycles, leading to high rates of sediment transport during periods of glacier or ice-sheet expansion. Probably because of the limited preservation potential of paraglacial sediments that were subsequently over-run by glacier ice, identification of paraglacial facies in both terrestrial and marine settings has been almost exclusively limited to sequences that post-date the Last Glacial Maximum. The unifying concept of paraglacial geomorphology is that of glacially conditioned sediment availability. Relaxation of landscape elements to nonglacial conditions operates over timescales of 101- {\textgreater} 104 years, and is conditioned by both process and spatial scale. Rate of sediment reworking can be described by an exhaustion model. In the case of primary reworking of glacigenic sediment, the rate of reworking declines approximately exponentially through time, though extrinsic perturbation may rejuvenate paraglacial sediment flux long after termination of the initial period of paraglacial adjustment. Landscape-scale (particularly alluvial and coastal) systems may exhibit intrinsically complex responses due to reworking of secondary paraglacial sediment stores. The long relaxation time of such systems implies that many areas deglaciated in the Late Pleistocene or Early Holocene have still not fully adjusted (in terms of sediment supply) to nonglacial conditions. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Weathering limits are defined most clearly on sandstone and gneiss, which have resisted frost shattering during the Late Devensian Lateglacial, but can also be distinguished on schists and quartzite. Schmidt hammer measurements and analyses of clay mineral assemblages indicate significantly more advanced rock and soil weathering above the weathering limits. The persistence of gibbsite above weathering limits indicates that they represent the upper limit of Late Devensian glacial erosion. The regular decline of weathering-limit altitudes along former flowlines eliminates the possibility that the weathering limits represent former thermal boundaries between protective cold-based and erosive warm-based ice. The weathering limits are therefore interpreted as periglacial trimlines that define the maximum surface altitude of the last ice sheet. Calculated basal shear stresses of 50--95\hspace{0.167em}kPa are consistent with this interpretation. Reconstruction of ice-sheet configuration indicates that the former ice-shed lay above 900\hspace{0.167em}m along the present watershed, and that the ice surface descended northwestwards, with broad depressions along major troughs and localised domes around independent centres of ice dispersal. Extrapolation of the ice surface gradient and altitude suggests that the ice sheet did not overrun the Outer Hebrides, but was confluent with the independent Outer Hebrides ice-cap in the North Minch basin. Erratics located up to 140\hspace{0.167em}m above the reconstructed ice surface are inferred to have been emplaced by a pre-Late Devensian ice sheet (or ice sheets) of unknown age. {\textcopyright} 1997 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract     = {Recent models of the last Scottish ice sheet suggest that nunataks remained above the ice surface in areas peripheral to the main centres of accumulation. This proposition has been investigated on 140 mountains over an area of 10,000 km2 in NW Scotland. Outside the limits of the later Loch Lomond Readvance in this area there is evidence for a single high-level weathering limit that separates glacially eroded terrain from higher areas of in situ frost debris. This limit occurs at altitudes ranging from 425 to 450 m in the Outer Hebrides to {\textgreater} 950 m on the mainland, and is best developed on lithologies that resisted breakdown after ice-sheet downwastage. Interpretation of this weathering limit as a periglacial trimline cut by the last ice sheet at its maximum thickness is supported by: (1) joint-depth and Schmidt hammer measurements that indicate significantly more advanced rock breakdown above the weathering limit; (2) a much greater representation of gibbsite (a pre-Late Devensian weathering product) in the clay fraction of soils above the limit; (3) cosmogenic isotope dating of the exposure ages of rock outcrops above and below the limit; (4) the sharpness of the limit at some sites and its regular decline along former ice flowlines; and (5) shear stress calculations based on the inferred altitude and gradient of the former ice surface. Reconstruction of the ice surface based on trimline evidence indicates that the mainland ice shed lay near or slightly east of the present watershed and descended northwards from {\textgreater} 900 m to ca. 550 m at the north coast. Independent dispersion centres fed broad ice streams that occupied major troughs. On Skye an ice dome {\textgreater} 800 m deflected the northwestwards movement of mainland ice, but the mountains of Rum were over-ridden by mainland ice up to an altitude of ca. 700 m. The Outer Hebrides supported an independent ice cap that was confluent with mainland ice in the Minches. Extrapolation of the trimline evidence indicates that most reconstructions of ice extent are too conservative, and suggests that low-gradient ice streams extended across the Hebridean Shelf offshore. Wider implications of this research are: (1) that blockfields and other periglacial weathering covers are not all of the same age or significance, depending on the resistance of different lithologies to frost weathering; (2) that the contrasting degree of glacial modification in the Western and Eastern Highlands of Scotland may reflect a former cover of predominantly warm-based ice in the former and predominantly cold-based ice in the latter; and (3) that the approach and techniques developed in this study have potential application for constraining ice-sheet models, not only in areas peripheral to the main centres of ice accumulation in Britain and Ireland, but also in other mountain areas where nunataks protruded through warm-based Late Pleistocene ice masses.},

We investigate two possible contributions to this contrast: (1) a shallow mechanism, essentially geochemical, comprising a difference in crustal heat production between the two terrains, and (2) a deeper mechanism, essentially geodynamical, arising from the existence of a lithospheric root beneath the Archean craton which diverts heat away from the craton into the thinner surrounding lithosphere. A finite element numerical model which explores the interplay between these two mechanisms suggests that a range of combinations of differences in crustal heat production and lithospheric thickness can lead to the contrast in surface heat flow observed in southern Africa. Additional constraints derived from seismological observations of cratonic roots, the correlation of surface heat flow and surface heat production, petrological estimates of the mean heat production in continental crust and constraints on upper mantle temperatures help narrow the range of acceptable models. Successful models suggest that a cratonic root beneath southern Africa extends to depths of 200-400 km. A root in this thickness range can divert enough heat to account for 50-100{\%} of the observed contrast in surface heat flow, the remainder being due to a difference in crustal heat production between the craton and the surrounding mobile belts in the range of zero to 0.35 $\mu$W m-3. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

  abstract      = {Different tectonic units cover the Antarctic territory: platform, orogens and depression structures. This structural variability is reflected both in thickness and physical properties of the crust. We present a new Moho map for the Antarctica, derived from geophysical data selected from the literature. The model covers the whole Antarctic region, from the South Pole out to the continental margin, including the Antarctic Peninsula. The Moho depth is represented with a resolution of 1??. ??. 1?? on a Cartesian grid obtained by an equidistant azimuthal geographical projection. A large volume of new data has been analyzed: mostly seismic experiments, as well as receiver functions and geological studies. In general, we can identify three large domains within the Antarctic continental crust. The oldest Archean and Proterozoic crust of East Antarctica has a thickness of 36-56. km (with an average of about 41. km). The continental crust of the Transantarctic Mountains, the Antarctic Peninsula and Wilkes Basin has a thickness of 30-40. km (with an average Moho of about 30. km). The youngest rifted continental crust of the West Antarctic Rift System has a thickness of 16-28. km (with an average Moho of about 26. km). The mean Moho depth of the whole model is 33.8. km. The new Moho model exhibits some remarkable disagreements at places with respect to global model CRUST 2.0. Difference between these two models may range up to -10/+. 24. km. The new model is available for download in digital format. We plan to update the model in the near future by including new data, particularly in the most poorly covered regions. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract     = {This review summarizes forefield and lacustrine records of glacier fluctuations in Alaska during the Holocene. Following retreat from latest Pleistocene advances, valley glaciers with land-based termini were in retracted positions during the early to middle Holocene. Neoglaciation began in some areas by 4.0 ka and major advances were underway by 3.0 ka, with perhaps two distinct early Neoglacial expansions centered respectively on 3.3-2.9 and 2.2-2.0 ka. Tree-ring cross-dates of glacially killed trees at two termini in southern Alaska show a major advance in the AD 550s-720s. The subsequent Little Ice Age (LIA) expansion was underway in the AD 1180s-1320s and culminated with two advance phases respectively in the 1540s-1710s and in the 1810s-1880s. The LIA advance was the largest Holocene expansion in southern Alaska, although older late Holocene moraines are preserved on many forefields in northern and interior Alaska. Tidewater glaciers around the rim of the Gulf of Alaska have made major advances throughout the Holocene. Expansions were often asynchronous with neighboring termini and spanned both warm and cool intervals, suggesting that non-climatic factors were important in forcing these advances. However, climatic warming appears to have initiated most rapid iceberg-calving retreats. Large glaciers terminating on the forelands around the Gulf of Alaska may have had tidewater termini early in the Holocene, but have progressively become isolated from the adjacent ocean by the accumulation and subaerial exposure of their own sediments. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract     = {Paleoclimatic variations in a particular region can be viewed as the outcome of the superimposition of the effects of a number of large-scale controls. A framework for understanding paleoclimatic variations in a region can be established by considering the long-term history of those controls jointly with climatic modeling results that illustrate how regional climates respond to changes of individual controls. The relevant controls of Late-Quaternary paleoclimatic variations in eastern Beringia include: (1) the size of the ice sheet, which influences both atmospheric circulation and temperature, (2) insolation, which influences mainly temperature and seasonality, (3) carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere, which influences temperature, and (4) feedbacks involving sea ice, sea-surface temperatures and snow cover, which reinforce the insolation effects. We review the results of a number of 'paleoclimatic experiments' with general circulation models to illustrate the potential response of eastern Beringia to the variations of these controls. We then present a framework for understanding paleoclimatic variations in eastern Beringia by describing the likely responses of the climate of this region to the known variations in the controls. In addition, we discuss key times during the Quaternary when particular combinations of the controls give rise to 'natural experiments' which lend themselves to the testing of particular hypotheses. Our understanding of the nature of climatic variations at high latitudes should increase through examination of paleoclimatic evidence that documents the response of the region at those key times. ?? 1992.},

  abstract     = {Over the past several decades, contrasting models have been proposed for the physical and chemical processes responsible for the uplift and long-term stability of the Colorado Plateau (CP) and crustal thinning beneath the Basin and Range Province (BRP) in the southwestern United States. Here we provide new constraints on the models by modeling gravity anomalies and by systematically analyzing over 15,500 P-to-S receiver functions recorded at 72 USArray and other broadband seismic stations on the southwestern CP and the southern BRP. Our results reveal that the BRP is characterized by a thin crust (28.2 $\pm$ 0.5 km), a mean Vp /Vs of 1.761 $\pm$ 0.014 and a mean amplitude (R) of P-to-S converted wave (relative to that of the direct P wave) of 0.181 $\pm$ 0.014 that are similar to a typical continental crust, consistent with the model that the thin crust was the consequence of lithospheric stretching during the Cenozoic. The CP is characterized by the thickest crust (42.3 $\pm$ 0.8 km), largest Vp/Vs (1.825 $\pm$ 0.009) and smallest R (0.105 $\pm$ 0.007) values in the study area. In addition, many stations on the CP exhibit a clear arrival before the P-to-S converted phase from the Moho, corresponding to a lower crustal layer of about 12 km thick with a mafic composition. We hypothesize that the lower crustal layer, which has an anomalously large density as revealed by gravity modeling and high velocities in seismic refraction lines, contributed to the long-term stability and preuplift low elevation of the Colorado Plateau.},

  abstract     = {Standard scientific operations on Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 204 documented a horizon of massive gas hydrate and highly saline pore water $\sim$0-20 m below the southern summit of Hydrate Ridge offshore Oregon. The sediment zone lies near active seafloor gas venting, raising the possibility that free gas co-exists with gas hydrate in shallow subsurface layers where pore waters have become too saline to precipitate additional gas hydrate. Here we discuss a unique experiment that addresses this important concept. A 1-m-long pressurized core was retrieved from $\sim$14 m below sea floor at Site 1249 and slowly degassed at $\sim$0 {$^{\circ}$}C in the laboratory over $\sim$178 h to determine in situ salinity and gas concentrations in the interval of massive gas hydrate. The core released $\sim$95 l of gas (predominantly methane), by far the greatest gas volume ever measured for a 1 m core at ambient shipboard pressure and temperature conditions. Geochemical mass-balance calculations and the pressure of initial gas release (4.2 MPa) both imply that pore waters had an in situ salinity approaching or exceeding 105 g kg-1, the approximate salinity required for a gas hydrate-free gas-brine system. Relatively high concentrations of propane and higher hydrocarbon gases at the start of core degassing also suggest the presence of in situ free gas. Gas hydrate, free gas and brine likely co-exist in shallow sediment of Hydrate Ridge. Near-seafloor brines, produced when rapid gas hydrate crystallization extracts large quantities of water, impact the distribution and cycling of gas and gas hydrate in this region and perhaps elsewhere. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract      = {With calculations of receiver functions and modelling of a seismic refraction profile we map the depth to the Moho discontinuity beneath Dronning Maud Land (DML), East Antarctica. The crustal converted signal (Ps) is clearly observable for all stations, suggesting that the crust is separated from the mantle by a sharp Moho. We reveal spatial variations in the crustal thickness and for some places the ratio of crustal P- to S-wave velocity. The crust beneath station Novolazarevskaja in central DML approaches a thickness of about 42 km and is characterized by low Vp/Vs ratio of about 1.67. This crustal thickness agrees well with previous wide-angle experiments. Further south, the Wohlthat Massif shows thickened crust with depths to Moho between 47 and 51 km indicative of an orogenic root. At station Weigel in the Kottas Mountains in western DML we determine a Moho depth of 44 km using the Ps traveltime. This depth corresponds well with the crustal model retrieved from a seismic refraction experiment across the Kottas Mountains. Moho depths approach values between 44 and 52 km beneath the profile. Underneath the middle of the profile, a remarkable Moho offset of approximately 7 km is observed. It appears to mark a suture between the Mesoproterozoic (1.2--1.0 Ga) Maudheim Province and the Kibarian (1.1--1.0 Ga) arc-related KottasMountains. The crustal thicknesses of mobile belts and undeformed areas in southern Africa and DML are remarkably similar. For station SNAA, situated on the Archean Grunehogna Craton, a fragment of the Kalahari--Kaapvaal--Craton, we obtained an ambiguous result that indicates a complex crustal structure.We determined a crustal thickness underneath SNAA of 39 km and a Vp/Vs ratio of 1.82. The latter higher value corresponds to a gabbroic crust, which was also deduced by former rock investigations. In addition, the presence of Jurassic basaltic intrusions into the predominantly gabbroic crust may contribute to the value.},

Variations of environmental magnetism and sedimentology of high-latitude loess deposits indicate that the timing and pattern of responses to local variations in wind intensity, storminess, and pedogenesis in eastern Beringia closely resemble the pattern of global climate change during the Late Quaternary deduced from studies of marine and ice core records. The age of paleoclimatic fluctuations, permafrost features, volcanic ash horizons, buried forest layers and paleosols, and other features of the eastern Beringian loess record can be determined using a variety of Quaternary dating methods. Tephrochronologic correlations between the loess record and the glacial history of eastern Beringia indicate the Delta Glaciation occurred during marine isotope stage 6. Several other middle and Late Quaternary glaciations across eastern Beringia can be tephrochronologically tied to the loess record, and appear to have been in phase with episodes of global cooling recorded in deep-sea records. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The motivation behind this development is to overcome the potential low performance of f-x deconvolution for signal-to-noise enhancement when processing highly complex geologic sections, data acquired using irregular trace spacing, and/or data contaminated with steeply dipping coherent noise. The resulting f-x EMD method is equivalent to an autoadaptive f-k filter with a frequency-dependent, high-wavenumber cut filtering property. Removing both random and steeply dipping coherent noise in either prestack or stacked/migrated sections is useful and compares well with other noise-reduction methods, such as f-x deconvolution, median filtering, and local singular value decomposition. In its simplest implementation, f-x EMD is parameter-free and can be ap...},

  abstract     = {The morphology of surface lakes strongly influences their ecology and limnology (Wetzel, 2001). This morphology is a result of both the geologic processes that produce topographic basins and the regional climatic and local hydrologic processes that control water depth and sediment infilling (Carroll and Bohacs, 1999). Although basin forming processes range from glacial scour to meteorite impacts (Cohen, 2003), the deepest, oldest surface lakes are tectonically controlled (Meybeck, 1995) and contain diverse exotic ecosystems (Rossiterm and Kawanabe, 2000). Subglacial lakes are also thought to be ancient systems that may contain exotic biota (Bulat et al., 2004; Karl et al., 1999; Priscu et al., 1999). Here we present evidence for the scale and configuration of 2 large subglacial lakes in East Antarctica that together with Lake Vostok define a province of major lakes on the flanks of the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains. Spatially-defined in the new Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery of Antarctica (T. Scambos et al., A MODIS-based mosaic of Antarctica: MOA, submitted to Remote Sensing of Environment, 2005, hereinafter referred to as Scambos et al., submitted manuscript, 2005), these lakes are aligned parallel to Lake Vostok. Other data shows that they are distinguished by distinct gravity lows, flat ice surface slopes and have estimated water depths of at least 900 m. Surface elevation data indicates that large deep subglacial lakes have a profound influence on the regional ice sheet topography and probably ice sheet flow. These deep subglacial lakes with elongate, rectilinear morphology are tectonically controlled features. Unlike the shallow lakes in West Antarctica and beneath Dome Concordia, these deep subglacial lakes remained stable environments through many glacial cycles since their origin 10 -35 Ma enabling the development of novel ecosystems.},

It has been widely suggested that different glacigenic diamicton facies possess distinct clast-fabric signatures. This paper examines this concept using a data set of 111; clast fabrics, and a synthesis of published results. Eigenvalues are calculated and compared for a variety sedimentary facies. It is concluded that clast fabric alone is not able to discriminate between different glacigenic facies, and it is argued that clast fabric offers little quantitative support in the interpretation of glacigenic sediments. It is suggested, therefore, that although clast fabric may continue to have a role as an indicator of relative strain at specific sites, its use in the discrimination of glacigenic facies is limited. Consequently, we should be much more selective in undertaking such analyses in the future. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

The oldest shell dates from raised marine deposits that provide minimum ages for the last deglaciation are 9300 cal. yr BP (northern Washington Land) and 7600 cal. yr BP (SW Washington Land). These dates indicate that Washington Land, which borders the central part of Nares Strait separating Greenland from Ellesmere Island in Canada, did not become free of glacier ice until well into the Holocene. The elevation of the marine limit falls from 110 m a.s.l. in the north to 60 m a.s.l. in the southwest. The recession was followed by readvance of glaciers in the late Holocene, and the youngest shell date from Neoglacial lateral moraines north of Humboldt Gletscher is 600 cal. yr BP. Since the Neoglacial maximum, probably around 100 years ago, glaciers have receded. The Holocene marine assemblages comprise a few southern extralimital records, notably of Chlamys islandica dated to 7300 cal. yr BP. Musk ox and reindeer disappeared from Washington Land recently, perhaps in connection with the cold period that culminated about 100 years ago.},

  abstract     = {A robust understanding of Antarctic Ice Sheet deglacial history since the Last Glacial Maximum is important in order to constrain ice sheet and glacial-isostatic adjustment models, and to explore the forcing mechanisms responsible for ice sheet retreat. Such understanding can be derived from a broad range of geological and glaciological datasets and recent decades have seen an upsurge in such data gathering around the continent and Sub-Antarctic islands. Here, we report a new synthesis of those datasets, based on an accompanying series of reviews of the geological data, organised by sector. We present a series of timeslice maps for 20ka, 15ka, 10ka and 5ka, including grounding line position and ice sheet thickness changes, along with a clear assessment of levels of confidence. The reconstruction shows that the Antarctic Ice sheet did not everywhere reach the continental shelf edge at its maximum, that initial retreat was asynchronous, and that the spatial pattern of deglaciation was highly variable, particularly on the inner shelf. The deglacial reconstruction is consistent with a moderate overall excess ice volume and with a relatively small Antarctic contribution to meltwater pulse 1a. We discuss key areas of uncertainty both around the continent and by time interval, and we highlight potential priorit. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

Interpretation of seismic velocities and amplitudes is based on theories of fluid-saturated and partially saturated rocks that have been available since the 1950s. Here we present a new synthesis of the same physical concepts that uses compressional-wave velocities together with shear-wave velocities in a scheme that is much simpler to understand and apply yet yields detailed information about porosity and fluid saturation magnitudes and spatial distribution. The key idea revolves around the fact that the density and the Lame elastic parameter a are the only two parameters determining seismic velocities that also contain information about fluid saturation. At low enough frequencies, Gassmann's well-known equations show that the shear modulus is independent of the fluid saturation level. We use these facts to construct saturation-proxy and data-sorting plots from seismic velocity data. The new method does not require reflectivity data. although it can use such information if available. The method can therefore be applied to a wide range of source-receiver configurations, including seismic reflection profiling (surface to surface), vertical seismic profiling (well to surface), and cross-well seismic transmission tomography (well to well), since availability of reflection data is not a requirement.},

By assuming volumetric debris contents in the deforming layer of the rock glacier of between 0.3 and 0.4, we obtained age estimates for the rock glaciers of between 12 ka and 24 ka. The corresponding average rockwall retreat rates are between 0.30 and 0.62 mm a-1. Considering the limitations of the model, we suggest a minimum age of 13 ka for the initiation of rock glacier development. Using this age, rockwall retreat rates for the seven rock glaciers investigated at Prins Karls Forland are between 0.13 and 0.64 m ka-1 (assuming the volumetric debris content for the whole rock glacier/talus cone is 0.35). The model requires further testing on other datasets, better field estimates of the debris content and depth of the deforming layer, and could also benefit from the inclusion of an unsteady debris supply function in order to refine age estimates.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a plate tectonic model for the evolution of the Australian continent between ca. 1800 and 1100 Ma. Between ca. 1800 and 1600 Ma episodic orogenesis occurred along the southern margin of the continent above a north-dipping subduction system. During this interval multiple orogenic events occurred. The West Australian Craton collided with the North Australian Craton (ca. 1790-1770 Ma), the Archaean nucleus of the Gawler Craton amalgamated with the North Australian Craton (ca. 1740-1690 Ma), and numerous smaller terranes accreted along the western Gawler Craton and the southern Arunta Inlier (ca. 1690-1640 Ma). The pattern of accretion suggests southward migration of the plate margin, which occurred due to a combination of slab rollback and back stepping of a subduction system behind the accreted continental blocks. Coeval with subduction a series of continental back-arc basins formed in the interior of the North Australian Craton and parts of the South Australian Craton, which were attached to the North Australian Craton prior to 1500 Ma. Extension of the North Australian Craton led to the opening of an oceanic basin along the eastern margin of the continent at ca. 1660 Ma. Continuing divergence was accommodated by oceanic spreading whereas the continental basins thermally subsided resulting in the development of sag-phase basins throughout the North Australian Craton. This oceanic basin was subsequently consumed during convergence, which ultimately led to development of a ca. 1600-1500 Ma orogenic belt along the eastern margin of Proterozoic Australia. Between ca. 1470 and 1100 Ma, the South Australian Craton, consisting of the Curnamona Province and the Gawler Craton rifted from the North Australian Craton and was re-attached in its present configuration during episodic ca. 1330-1100 Ma orogenesis, which is preserved in the Albany-Fraser Belt and the Musgrave Block. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {Shallow high-resolution seismic reflection surveys have traditionally been restricted to either compressional (P) or horizontally polarized shear (SH) waves in order to produce 2-D images of subsurface structure. The northernmost Mississippi embayment and coincident New Madrid seismic zone (NMSZ) provide an ideal laboratory to study the experimental use of integrating P- and SH-wave seismic profiles, integrated, where practicable, with micro-gravity data. In this area, the relation between "deeper" deformation of Paleozoic bedrock associated with the formation of the Reelfoot rift and NMSZ seismicity and "shallower" deformation of overlying sediments has remained elusive, but could be revealed using integrated P- and SH-wave reflection. Surface expressions of deformation are almost non-existent in this region, which makes seismic reflection surveying the only means of detecting structures that are possibly pertinent to seismic hazard assessment. Since P- and SH-waves respond differently to the rock and fluid properties and travel at dissimilar speeds, the resulting seismic profiles provide complementary views of the subsurface based on different levels of resolution and imaging capability. P-wave profiles acquired in southwestern Illinois and western Kentucky (USA) detect faulting of deep, Paleozoic bedrock and Cretaceous reflectors while coincident SH-wave surveys show that this deformation propagates higher into overlying Tertiary and Quaternary strata. Forward modeling of micro-gravity data acquired along one of the seismic profiles further supports an interpretation of faulting of bedrock and Cretaceous strata. The integration of the two seismic and the micro-gravity methods therefore increases the scope for investigating the relation between the older and younger deformation in an area of critical seismic hazard. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {Continental lithosphere is in unstable mechanical equilibrium because its mantle layer is denser than the asthenosphere. If any process such as cracking, slumping, or plume erosion initially provided an elongated conduit connecting the underlying asthenosphere with the base of the continental crust, the dense lithospheric boundary layer could peel away from the crust and sink. An analytic model for sink- ing velocities at the critical initial time shows that instability occurs if the effective viscosities of the lower continental crust and the rising asthenosphere are no more than 10 $\bullet$9 P. Analogies to subduction suggest that the mature instability would grow laterally at plate tectonic velocities; however, it would be almost aseismic. Loss of the cold mantle boundary layer would cause uplift, increased heat flow, reduced seismic velocities, and perhaps eraplacement of basalt flows, mantle diatremes, and granodiorite sills. A one-di- mensional thermal model of the formation of a new boundary layer predicts a half life of about 3 x 107 years for this thermal anomaly and uplift. As an example, the geologic and geophysical data from the Colorado Plateau are shown to be consistent with the hypothesis that it was uplifted by a delamination event 30 m.y. ago and perhaps a second event about 5 m.y. ago.},

We compare the platelike (nonorogen) regions of model PB2002 (Bird, 2003) with the centroid moment tensor (CMT) catalog to select apparent boundary half-widths and then assign 95{\%} of shallow earthquakes to one of these settings. A tapered Gutenberg-Richter model of the frequency/moment relation is fit to the subcatalog for each setting by maximum likelihood. Best-fitting beta values range from 0.53 to 0.92, but all 95{\%} confidence ranges are consistent with a common value of 0.61-0.66. To better determine some corner magnitudes we expand the subcatalogs by (1) inclusion of orogens and (2) inclusion of years 1900-1975 from the catalog of Pacheco and Sykes (1992). Combining both earthquake statistics and the platetectonic constraint on moment rate, corner magnitudes include the following: CRB, 7.64(-0.26)(+0.76); CTF, 8.01(-0.21)(+0.47); CCB, 8.46(-0.39)(+0.21); OCB, 8.04(-0.22)(+0.52); SUB, 9.58(-0.46)(+0.48); Coupled lithosphere thicknesses are found to be the following: CRB, 3.0(-1.4)(+7.0); CTF, 8.6(-4)(+11); CCB, 18(-11)(+?); OSR, 0.13(-0.09)(+0.13) for normal faulting and 0.40(-0.21)(+?) for strike slip; OTF, 13(-7.3)(+?), 1.8(-0.5)(+1.1), and 1.6(-0.5)(+1.1) at low, medium, and high velocities; OCB, 3.8(-2.3)(+13.7); and SUB, 18.0(-10.8)(+?). In general, high coupling of subduction and continental plate boundaries suggests that here all seismic gaps are dangerous unless proven to be creeping. In general, low coupling within oceanic lithosphere suggests a different model of isolated seismic fault patches Surrounded by large seismic gaps that may be permanent.},

Here we largely solve this 'suck in and smear syndrome' for radiocarbon (14 C) dated sequences. In a Bayesian framework, millions of plausible age-models are constructed to quantify the chronological uncertainties within and between proxy archives. We test the technique on replicated high-resolution 14 C-dated peat cores deposited during the 'Little Ice Age' (c. AD 1400 {\'{A}}1900), a period characterized by abrupt climate changes and severe 14 C calibration problems. Owing to internal variability in proxy data and uncertainties in age-models, these (and possibly many more) archives are not consistent in recording decadal climate change. Through explicit statistical tests of palaeoenvironmental hypotheses, we can move forward to systematic interpretations of proxy data. However, chronological uncertainties of non-annually resolved palaeoclimate records are too large for answering decadal timescale questions.},

The method of WMD is discussed, and its advantages and limitations are compared with calibration of individual dates. A numerical approach to WMD is introduced that makes it possible to assess the precision of WMD chronologies. During several intervals of the Holocene, the 14C calibration curve shows less pronounced fluctuations. We assess whether wigglematching is also a feasible strategy for these parts of the 14C calibration curve.

Of particular interest in Antarctica are the crustal thickness variations under the Transantarctic Mountains and Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains, whose formation mechanisms are still debated. We have used a mean, global gravity field from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) to estimate the depth to the Moho in East and West Antarctica through gravity inversion. We then combined the depth to Moho and known topography to estimate the total crustal thickness. Thick crust is resolved along the full length of the Transantarctic Mountains with a maximum crustal thickness of 46 km predicted near the pole and thinner ({\~{}} 40 km) crust in both northern Victoria Land and under the Pensacola Mountains. Within East Antarctica, the model predicts crust over 40 km thick below the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains, which may be the result of a Neoproterozoic suture zone underlying the ice sheet. In addition to addressing long-standing questions about the nature of East Antarctica's major mountain ranges, an improved estimate of crustal thickness variability may improve long-wavelength geodynamic and glaciological models of the continent. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {The growing importance of understanding past abrupt climate variability at a regional and global scale has led to the realisation that independent chronologies of past environmental change need to be compared between various archives. This has in turn led to attempts at significant improvements in the required precision at which records can be dated. Radiocarbon dating is still the most prominent method for dating organic material from terrestrial and marine archives, and as such many of the recent developments in improving precision have been aimed at this technique. These include: (1) selection of the most suitable datable fractions within a record, (2) the development of better calibration curves, and (3) more precise age modelling techniques. While much attention has been focussed on the first two items, testing the possibilities of the relatively new age modelling approaches has not received much attention. Here, we test the potential for methods designed to significantly improve precision in radiocarbon-based age models, wiggle match dating and various forms of Bayesian analyses. We demonstrate that while all of the methods can perform very well, in some scenarios, caution must be taken when applying them. It appears that an integrated approach is required in real life dating situations where more than one model is applied, with strict error calculation, and with the integration of radiocarbon data with sedimentological analyses of site formation processes. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract     = {U-Pb age data from southwest Madagascar provide a compelling case that the pre-Gondwana Indian plate was stitched with the arc terranes of the Arabian Nubian Shield along a suture that closed between 580 Ma and 520 Ma. The key observations supportive of this interpretation are: (1) metamorphism dated to 630-600 Ma is manifested only on the west side of the suture in rocks that have affinities with the oceanic and island arc terranes of the Arabian Nubian Shield, or which represent continental rocks welded to these terranes prior to the amalgamation of Gondwana, and (2) orogenesis at 580-520 Ma is manifest in rocks on both sides of the suture, an observation taken to mark the timing of collision and to reflect spatial continuity across the suture. In southwest Madagascar the distribution of metamorphic ages places the suture along the Beraketa high-strain zone, the tectonic boundary between the Androyen and Anosyen domains. Similar age relationships allow for the extrapolation of this tectonic boundary into both East Antarctica and Africa.},

  abstract     = {A review of U-Pb age data from intrusive and volcanic rocks for Antarctica and Australia has highlighted the remarkable synchronicity in the shift from passive margin or continental arc tectonism, to convergent orogenesis along the Pacific margin of Gondwana. This event, the Ross-Delamerian Orogeny, marks a distinct and rapid shift in the style of deformation, rate of uplift, volume of magmatism and syn-orogenic sedimentation along the entire 4000+ km length of the orogen. The Ross-Delamerian Orogeny is constrained to have begun at 515??5 Ma, an interval that also encompasses the youngest collisional events that lead to the suturing of Gondwana. We propose that these geographically separate events are intimately linked and represent the cause and effect of a major tectonic reorganisation in the motion of the Earth's plates. We suggest the mechanism controlling this Early to Middle Cambrian plate reorganisation was the rapid reduction in relative motion, driven by continental collision, between the final two components of Gondwana. Due to the need to maintain a zero sum for all plate motions, the change in the rate of convergence at this boundary resulted in compensatory changes elsewhere in the global plate circuit. One such change was an increase in the rate and perhaps direction of convergence along the Pacific margin of Gondwana. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {Interpretation of uncertain data is the basis for understanding many Earth processes; in particular, uncertain data underpin much of the world's hydrocarbon exploration and future carbon minimization strategies (CO2 storage and radioactive waste disposal). It is therefore crucial to develop techniques and protocols that will improve geoscientists' interpretational accuracy. We asked 184 academic and industry experts to interpret a typical oil-industry syn- thetic seismic refl ection data set and found that just over one-third got the {\textquotedblleft}right{\textquotedblright} answer. Using multivariate analyses we show that interpretational accuracy is signifi cantly improved for experts educated to the level of a Master's degree and/or doctorate (Ph.D.) (regardless of years of experience). Furthermore, although only 18 of 184 experts validated their interpreta- tion by checking geometric and evolutionary feasibility, these experts were almost three times more likely to produce the correct result than those that did not. These results would not have been apparent from traditional detailed expert elicitation studies, as their sample sizes are too small. Our fi ndings strongly suggest that signifi cant improvements in the reliability of interpretations of inherently uncertain geological data sets could be made by increasing the proportion of people recruited into industry and academia who have a Master's or Ph.D. degree, and by changes to industry workfl ows and quality assurance procedures to explicitly include validation techniques.},

  abstract     = {Landform analysis of basement rocks has been undertaken with the aid of digital elevation data, aerial photographs and field observations in central West Greenland (69{$^{\circ}$}15$\prime$N-66{$^{\circ}$}00$\prime$N). Palaeosurfaces have been identified, dated relatively to each other, used to quantify uplift and fault movements and also used to estimate differential erosion. Two types of palaeosurfaces were mapped across the Precambrian basement: a surface at low elevation with distinct hills (hilly relief), and two planation surfaces formed across different types of basement rocks. The hilly relief surface emerges as an inclined surface from Cretaceous cover rocks in Disko Bugt and is interpreted as a stripped late Mesozoic etch surface. This surface is cut off towards the south by a less inclined planation surface, which is younger and thus of Cenozoic age. It is similar to the post-Eocene (Miocene?) planation surfaces identified on Disko and Nuussuaq in other studies. The planation surface splits in two southwards towards high areas around Nordre Isortoq and Sukkertoppen Ice Cap. The upper planation surface forms near-summit areas of tectonic blocks dipping in different directions and with different tilts. The uplift centres define the crests of two mega blocks, separated by the 'Sisimiut Line' which coincides with the Precambrian Ikert{\^{o}}q thrust zone. A partially developed lower planation surface indicates a first uplift of maximum 500{~}m followed by a second uplift of maximum 1000{~}m. We infer that these uplift events occurred during the late Neogene based on correlation with similar surfaces on Nuussuaq and the timing of exhumational events estimated from apatite fission track analyses of samples from a deep borehole on Nuussuaq (reported elsewhere). The difference between a reconstruction of the upper planation surface across the entire area and the present topography was used as an estimate of erosion of basement rock since the formation of the upper planation surface. The erosion is unevenly distributed and varies from almost none on the well-preserved planation surfaces to 800-1300{~}m along valleys, and even more in the fjords. Erosion is less within areas of gneiss in granulite facies, than in areas of gneiss in amphibolite facies. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {The reconstruction of Laurentia, Australia, and Antarctica into a Proterozoic supercontinent is evaluated by analyzing the fit of Precambrian provinces defined by isotopic and geochronologic mapping. The analysis is complicated by allochthonous segments of the Antarctic and eastern Australian margins. Removal of the allochthonous provinces produces a closer fit of the continents; there is a match of Early Proterozoic basement between southwestern Laurentia and the only exposure of craton known from the paleo-Pacific margin of Antarctica. In addition, western Laurentia is brought closer to the Australian Gawler block, consistent with provenance interpretations of the Belt Supergroup. Removal of the allochthonous provinces by right-lateral translation relative to the Antarctic craton margin places them in a pre-750 Ma position where they could be southwestward extensions of the Yavapai-Mazatzal and Grenville provinces of southern Laurentia. This modified reconstruction leads to a prediction of extensive Archean basement in Antarctica between the South Pole and Victoria Land, a prediction partly borne out by Archean rocks in the Miller Range of the Transantarctic Mountains; it also predicts the presence of 1.4 Ga rapakivi granites in the Transantarctic Mountains basement. This configuration implies assembly of the Australia-Antarctica Gondwana margin by terrane accretion following, or accompanied by, left-lateral translation. This is compatible with a tectonic regime of clockwise rotation of Laurentia relative to Australia and Antarctica after rifting. Thus, the proposed supercontinent, with some modifications, has potential for explaining several aspects of the pattern of Precambrian provinces in the three continents.},

The specific surface is normally measured by nitrogen adsorption but is here measured by image analysis of scanning electron micrographs. This method concentrates on the micritic matrix alone. Deep-sea sediments are ideally suited to the study of burial diagenesis because they accumulate in a relatively conservative tectonic setting. We used material from the Ontong Java Plateau in the Pacific, where a {\textgreater}{~}1{~}km thick package of chalk facies sediments accumulated from the Cretaceous to the present. In the upper 200--300{~}m the sediment is unconsolidated carbonate ooze, throughout this depth interval compaction is the principal porosity reducing agent, but recrystallization has an equal or larger influence on the textural development. In the chalk interval below, compaction is not the only porosity reducing agent but it has a larger influence on texture than concurrent recrystallization. Below 850{~}m grain-bridging cementation becomes important resulting in a lithified limestone below 1100{~}m. This interpretation is based on specific surface data alone, and modifies current diagenetic models.},

Detailed multi-proxy analyses including microfossils (e.g., pollen, spores, algae, and fungal spores), macroremains (e.g., seeds, fruits, wood, mosses, etc.), and loss on ignition measurements were carried out with high temporal resolution. To link the five Preboreal records, accurate chronologies were produced by AMS 14C wiggle-match dating. The Dutch records show that following the Lateglacial/Holocene climate warming, birch woodlands expanded between 11,530 and 11,500 cal BP during the Friesland Phase of the Preboreal. After the Friesland Phase, two distinct climatic shifts could be inferred: (1) around 11,430-11,350 cal BP the expansion of birch forests was interrupted by a dry continental phase with open grassland vegetation, the Rammelbeek Phase. This phase was coeval with the coldest part of the Preboreal oscillation (PBO) as observed in the ??18O record of the Greenland ice-core records and has been attributed to a large meltwater flux that resulted in a temporary decrease of the thermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic. (2) At the start of the Late Preboreal, between 11,270 and 11,210 cal BP, a sudden shift to a more humid climate occurred and birch forests expanded again. A simultaneous increase in the cosmogenic nuclides 14C and 10Be suggests that these changes in climate and vegetation were forced by a sudden decline in solar activity. Expansion of pine occurred during the later part of the Late Preboreal. At the onset of the Boreal, between 10,770 and 10,700 cal BP, dense woodlands with hazel, oak, elm and pine started to develop in The Netherlands. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

On the basis of a Jeffreys-Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (JWKB) description of surface wave propagation we find and discuss the lateral variations of the sensitivity of Love and Rayleigh waves to mantle seismic anomalies, associated with a realistic model of the crust [Mooney et al., 1998]. We then use the resulting laterally varying sensitivity kernels to determine a new tomographic image of horizontally and vertically polarized shear velocity in the upper mantle from Love and Rayleigh wave phase velocity measurements (periods from 35 to 300 s). In terms of large-scale patterns of high and low velocity our model is similar to previously published ones, confirming, among other features, the anomalous anisotropy underlying the central Pacific [Ekstr{\"{o}}m and Dziewonski, 1998]; we find, however, that the lateral dependence of the surface wave sensitivity kernels has a significant effect on the absolute amplitude of the anomalies, which should not be neglected as we attempt to obtain higher-resolution images of the upper mantle.},

  abstract     = {Satellite images provide unique means of identifying large-scale flow-generated lineations produced by former ice sheets. They can be interpreted to reconstruct the major elements which make up the integrated, large-scale structure of ice sheets: ice divides; ice streams; interstream ridges; ice shelves; calving bays. The evolving palaeoglaciological structure of the European ice sheet during its decay from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is reconstructed by reference to these components and in the context of a new map showing isochrons of retreat. During the retreat phase in particular the time-dependent dynamic evolution of the ice sheet and the pattern of ice stream development are reconstructed. Crossing lineations are widespread. The older ones are suggested to have formed during molten bed phases of ice sheet growth and preserved by frozen bed conditions during the glacial maximum, particularly in areas which lay, during deglaciation, beneath ice divides and inter-ice stream ridges, both areas of slow flow and possibly frozen bed conditions. Four phases of growth (A1 to A4) and five phases of decay (R1 to R5) are used to describe the major climatically and dynamically determined stages in the evolution of the ice sheet through the last glacial cycle. The growth and decay patterns are quite different and associated with major shifts in the ice divide, reflecting growth from the Fennoscandian mountains and decay away from marine influenced margins. These patterns were determined by the locations of nucleation areas; spatial patterns of climate; and calving at marine margins. The prevalence of streaming within the retreating ice sheet suggests that the mean elevation of the ice sheet was lower than predicted from glaciological models which do not include streaming, and that this might reconcile glaciological models and earth rheology models which infer paleao-ice sheet thickness by inverting sea level data. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract     = {The glacier Holmstr??mbreen, in Spitsbergen, surged into the ice contact scarp of a proglacial outwash sequence at some time during its Neoglacial maximum. The outwash sediments were pushed along a decollement to produce a moraine in which deformation extended for 1.5 km beyon the furthest extent of the glacier front. The style of folding and faulting and the nature of the pre-, syn- and post-tectonic, sedimentary sequence across the whole push moraine is described from a continuously exposed section of the push moraine which extends from its proximal to distal extremities. The precise extent of incremental compressive shortening of the pushed sediments, of some 900 m, is established. The depth to the underlying decollement is inferred to be an average of about 30 m, indicating that stresses and movement were transmitted through a thin nappe with an aspect ratio of about 1 in 30. It is suggested that this nappe was frozen and that an artesian water pressure head of 60 m immediately beneath it reduced friction along its base to a very low value. It is calculated that a glacially generated force of about 1.5??107 kN was reponsible for pushing the sediment nappe. The nature of the glacially controlled groundwater flow system rather than the magnitude of longitudinal forces generated by the glacier is the principle determinant of large-scale push moraine characteristics. The changing ice topography produced by the pushing event during the surge and in the post-surge decay had a major influence on the evolution of the meltwater drainage system and the style of fluvial sedimentation. The structure, sedimentary architecture and evolution of the whole glacitectonic/fluvial complex can best be understood by considering the impact of the surge on a complete outwash system. It is suggested that the setting and processes which produced the Holmstr??mbreen push moraine could account for many broad, multi-ridge and fold push moraines which formed proglacially, and that the thickness of original sediments above the decollement can be a guide to the thickness of contemporary permafrost. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {We propose that prior to the Younger Dryas period, the Arctic Ocean supported extremely thick multi-year fast ice overlain by superimposed ice and firn. We re-introduce the historical term paleocrystic ice to describe this. The ice was independent of continental (glacier) ice and formed a massive floating body trapped within the almost closed Arctic Basin, when sea-level was lower during the last glacial maximum. As sea-level rose and the Barents Sea Shelf became deglaciated, the volume of warm Atlantic water entering the Arctic Ocean increased, as did the corresponding egress, driving the paleocrystic ice towards Fram Strait. New evidence shows that Bering Strait was resubmerged around the same time, providing further dynamical forcing of the ice as the Transpolar Drift became established. Additional freshwater entered the Arctic Basin from Siberia and North America, from proglacial lakes and meltwater derived from the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Collectively, these forces drove large volumes of thick paleocrystic ice and relatively fresh water from the Arctic Ocean into the Greenland Sea, shutting down deepwater formation and creating conditions conducive for extensive sea-ice to form and persist as far south as 60??N. We propose that the forcing responsible for the Younger Dryas cold episode was thus the result of extremely thick sea-ice being driven from the Arctic Ocean, dampening or shutting off the thermohaline circulation, as sea-level rose and Atlantic and Pacific waters entered the Arctic Basin. This hypothesis focuses attention on the potential role of Arctic sea-ice in causing the Younger Dryas episode, but does not preclude other factors that may also have played a role. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {Many palaeoclimate records from the North Atlantic region show a pattern of rapid climate oscillations, the so-called Dansgaard-Oeschger events, with a quasi-periodicity of approximately 1,470 years for the late glacial period. Various hypotheses have been suggested to explain these rapid temperature shifts, including internal oscillations in the climate system and external forcing, possibly from the Sun. But whereas pronounced solar cycles of approximately 87 and approximately 210 years are well known, a approximately 1,470-year solar cycle has not been detected. Here we show that an intermediate-complexity climate model with glacial climate conditions simulates rapid climate shifts similar to the Dansgaard-Oeschger events with a spacing of 1,470 years when forced by periodic freshwater input into the North Atlantic Ocean in cycles of approximately 87 and approximately 210 years. We attribute the robust 1,470-year response time to the superposition of the two shorter cycles, together with strongly nonlinear dynamics and the long characteristic timescale of the thermohaline circulation. For Holocene conditions, similar events do not occur. We conclude that the glacial 1,470-year climate cycles could have been triggered by solar forcing despite the absence of a 1,470-year solar cycle.},

Access to North East Russia, in particular, has provided the opportunity to evaluate the Beringia landscape as a contiguous subcontinent during the Quaternary. For the first time, new research has made clearer the connection between tectonic forces and the submergence of the Bering Strait during the middle Pliocene. Revisions in the regional stratigraphy of glacial and interglacial deposits in northwest Alaska and northeast Russia provide a new foundation for assessing the causes for differences in glacial ice extent through time. The consensus of all field workers verifies that glacial ice throughout most of Beringia was of very limited extent during the last glacial maximum. The onset of regional glaciation during the waning stages of the last interglaciation is clearly out of phase with glaciation at lower latitudes. Despite the lack of much glacial activity during the early Holocene, Alaska contains a rich record of late Holocene glacial response to Neoglacial cooling. Changes in the Holocene environment of Beringia likely had a profound affect on early inhabitants. The curiosity-driven vision and spirit of both David Hopkins and the late Troy Pewe have had a profound influence on Arctic paleoenvironmental research. ?? 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract  = {The last interglacial high sea-level stand, the Pelukian transgression of isotope substage 5e, is recorded along the western and northern coasts of Alaska by discontinuous but clearly traceable marine terraces and coastal landforms up to about 10 m altitude. The stratigraphy indicates that sea level reached this altitude only once during the last interglacial cycle. From the type area at Nome, to St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea, to the eastern limit of the Beaufort Sea, Pelukian deposits contain extralimital faunas indicating that coastal waters were warmer than present. Amino acid ratios in molluscs from these deposits decrease to the north toward Barrow, consistent with the modern regional temperature gradient. Fossil assemblages at Nome and St. Lawrence Island suggest that the winter sea-ice limit was north of Bering Strait, at least 800 km north of its present position, and the Bering Sea was perennially ice-free. Microfauna in Pelukian sediments recovered from boreholes indicate that Atlantic water may have been present on the shallow Beaufort Shelf, suggesting that the Arctic Ocean was not stratified and the Arctic sea-ice cover was not perennial for some period. In coastal regions of western Alaska, spruce woodlands extended westward beyond their modern range and in northern Alaska, on the Arctic Coastal Plain, spruce groves may have entered the upper Colville River basin. The Flaxman Member of the Gubik Formation on the Alaskan Arctic Coastal Plain was deposited during marine isotope substage 5a and records the breakup of an intra-stage 5 ice sheet over northwestern Keewatin.},

Marine deposits and glacial diamicton stratigraphically below the type section record, respectfully, the peak of the last interglacial (marine oxygen-isotope substage 5e) and rapid glacierization of the coastal mountains probably during substage 5d or 5b. Correlative deposits recording a similar sequence of intra-stage 5 events, but once thought to be of early and middle Pleistocene age, include the Upper and Lower Pinakul' Suite at Cape Pinakul' grid marine deposits near the Nunyamo River on the Gulf of Anadyr, based upon amino-acid analyses, biostratigraphy, and supporting geochronology. These deposits enclose warmer-than-present faunas and floras comparible to last interglacial Pelukian marine deposits found along the coast of Alaska. The last major advance of glacial ice from Chukotka Peninsula across Anadyr Strait and onto St. Lawrence Island was likely initiated during the part of stage 5 based on our reinterpretaion of the stratigraphy at Cape Pinakul', near the Nunyamo River, and on northwestern St. Lawrence Island. Chukotkan ice probably reached St. Lawrence Island sometime during oxygen-isotope stage 4. Ice extend across Chukotka during the LGM was very imited. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract     = {It is generally assumed that regions glaciated by continental ice sheets offer little promise for long paleoenvironmental records due to erosional processes associated with glaciation. We show that beneath portions of the northeastern Laurentide Ice Sheet, characterized by cold-based glaciation, sediment sequences representing multiple interglaciations have been preserved within extant lake basins. Radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence dating confirm the antiquity of the sediments, thereby extending the terrestrial paleoenvironmental record of the Canadian Arctic by hundreds of thousands of years. The lake sediment record presented here corroborates numerous recent cosmogenic exposure dating studies indicating complex patterns of erosion beneath polar ice sheets. It also demonstrates that the presence of intact interglacial sediments does not demand unglaciated refugia. Similarly ancient sediments may be preserved in many regions formerly covered by Pleistocene ice sheets.},

  abstract     = {Melting glaciers and ice caps on Baffin Island contribute roughly half of the sea-level rise from all ice in Arctic Canada, although they comprise only one-fourth of the total ice in the region. The uncertain future response of arctic glaciers and ice caps to climate change motivates the use of paleodata to evaluate the sensitivity of glaciers to past warm intervals and to constrain mechanisms that drive glacier change. We review the key patterns and chronologies of latest Pleistocene and Holocene glaciation on Baffin Island. The deglaciation by the Laurentide Ice Sheet occurred generally slowly and steadily throughout the Holocene to its present margin (Barnes Ice Cap) except for two periods of rapid retreat: An early interval $\sim$12 to 10 ka when outlet glaciers retreated rapidly through deep fiords and sounds, and a later interval $\sim$7 ka when ice over Foxe Basin collapsed. In coastal settings, alpine glaciers were smaller during the Younger Dryas period than during the Little Ice Age. At least some alpine glaciers apparently survived the early Holocene thermal maximum, which was several degrees warmer than today, although data on glacier extent during the early Holocene is extremely sparse. Following the early Holocene thermal maximum, glaciers advanced during Neoglaciation, beginning in some places as early as $\sim$6 ka, although most sites do not record near-Little Ice Age positions until $\sim$3.5 to 2.5 ka. Alpine glaciers reached their largest Holocene extents during the Little Ice Age, when temperatures were $\sim$1-1.5 {$^{\circ}$}C cooler than during the late 20\textsuperscript{th} century. Synchronous advances across Baffin Island throughout Neoglaciation indicate sub-Milankovitch controls on glaciation that could involve major volcanic eruptions and solar variability. Future work should further elucidate the state of glaciers and ice caps during the early Holocene thermal maximum and glacier response to climate forcing mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract     = {Seventy-three new Be/Al ages from 57 moraine boulders and 2 tors, together with 43 previously published cosmogenic exposure ages from 41 moraine boulders, allow us to critique the use of cosmogenic exposure (CE) dating of moraine boulders in Alaska. Boulder exhumation during moraine degradation likely gives rise to the largest uncertainty in constraining the timing of initial moraine stabilization following ice retreat. Isotopic inheritance appears to be most important for moraines deposited close to their cirque headwalls. Boulder-surface (bedrock) erosion rate can be roughly constrained and leads to a range in moraine stabilization ages. Snow-cover history is difficult to constrain, but its effect is thought to be minor for the tall boulders sampled. Despite these complications, the CE ages provide important new information regarding the timing of the last and penultimate glaciations in Alaska. Three penultimate moraines yielded CE ages that overlap with marine isotope stage (MIS) 4/early MIS 3 (4565 ka) rather than MIS 6 (ca. 140 ka). Based on a combination of our new CE chronologies and existing C ages from six study areas, glaciers retreated from their local late Wisconsin maxima: ca. 2427 ka, Kokrines Hills (west-interior Alaska); ca. 2426 ka, northeastern Brooks Range (NE Alaska); ca. 2123 ka, Yukon Tanana Upland (east-interior Alaska); ca. 22 ka, Ahklun Mountains (SW Alaska); ca. 20 ka, western Alaska Range (central Alaska); ca. 1618 ka, Chuilnuk Mountains (SW Alaska). Overall, glacier retreat was concurrent with the peak of the last global glacial maximum, probably in response to limited moisture availability.},

  abstract     = {A long-standing debate regarding the reconstruction of former ice sheets revolves around the use of relative weathering of landscapes, i.e., the assumption that highly weathered landscapes have not been recently glaciated. New cosmogenic isotope measurements from upland bedrock surfaces and erratics along the northeastern margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) shed light on this debate, 10Be and 26Al concentrations from three perched erratics, yielding cosmogenic exposure ages of 17-11 ka, are much lower than those measured in two unmodified, highly weathered tors upon which they lie, which yield cosmogenic exposure ages of {\textgreater} 60 ka. These findings suggest that non-erosive ice covered weathered upland surfaces along the northeastern margin of the LIS during the last glacial maximum. These data challenge the use of relative weathering to define the margins of Pleistocene ice sheets. The juxtaposition of non-erosive ice over upland plateaus and erosive ice in adjacent fiords requires strong gradients in basal thermal regimes, suggestive of an ice-stream mode of glaciation. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

These relatively narrow corridors play a critical role in feedbacks between landscape evolution and ice sheet dynamics. Here we combine bedrock 10Be concentrations with distribution of lakes on Baffin Island, Arctic Canada, to constrain the pattern of glacial modification at a fjord onset zone - the region of increasing relief from the continental interior to the fjord head. High lake density and a lack of 10Be inheritance in the valley bottom indicate significant glacial scouring for some duration of the last glacial cycle. In contrast, 10Be inheritance and a lack of lakes at higher elevations indicate a lack of glacial scour and only slight glacial modification despite the entire region being covered by the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the last glaciation. This pattern of glacial erosion at the fjord onset zone is similar to what is found in the outer fjords ??? 100??km toward the last glacial maximum ice margin, and indicates that ice flow becomes organized well inland from the fjorded coast. The relief-generating process of selective linear erosion occurs at the fjord onset zone and was responsible for evolving Baffin Island fjords even in the late Quaternary. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {The mid-Pliocene warming episode is well established along the margins of the North Atlantic and probably affected areas as far north as Iceland. Rich marine mollusc faunas have been described from the 500 m of Pliocene siliciclastic deposits on the Tj??rnes Peninsula in northeast Iceland. The faunal compositions indicate a development from warm-water to arcto-boreal conditions. We have analysed the oxygen isotope composition of 96 well-preserved specimens of the bivalves Arctica islandica and Pygocardia rustica and interpreted the data as palaeotemperatures. After corrections for the isotopic composition of Pliocene seawater, the temperatures are in accordance with other palaeotemperature proxies. We interpret our data as reflecting a gradual change from warm-water conditions (summer temperatures between 10 and 15??C) during the deposition of the lower part of the Tj??rnes beds (Tapes Zone and lower part of Mactra Zone) to cold-water conditions (summer temperatures between 5 and 10??C) at the top (top of Mactra Zone and Serripes Zone). The coldest interval is found in the middle of the Serripes Zone, where summer temperatures (5-8??C) are comparable to those of the present environment off northern Iceland. The arrival to Tj??rnes of cold-water molluscs of Pacific origin postdates the cooling of the seas around Iceland. We suggest that the cold interval in the Serripes Zone represents a cooling event prior to the final warm period (ca. 3.3-3.0 Ma [Dowsett et al.

Constraints from seismic data on average velocities and lower mantle velocity gradients are hard to reconcile with an adiabatic pyrolitic mantle, given the current state of knowledge of elastic and anelastic mineral parameters at high pressure and temperature. This physical model generally gives (a) a stronger baseline offset between upper and lower mantle average travel-time residuals than allowed by the data and (b) an insufficient decrease in velocity with depth in the lower mantle (above 2500 km). We tested 105 upper and 105 lower mantle models that were selected randomly within the mineral parameter uncertainties. Only 2 lower mantle models and 24 upper mantle models yield whole mantle seismic structures that are compatible with global ISC P and S travel times and central frequencies of toroidal and spheroidal fundamental modes with angular order higher than 18. To improve the fit to the seismic data, the physical model would require (a) a lower velocity transition zone composition than dry pyrolite (at least around continents and subduction zones) as well as (b) a gradual change in physical state of the lower mantle that decreases the velocity-depth gradient, e.g., a superadiabatic temperature gradient. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {Constraints on mantle temperatures are fundamental for a better understanding of the dynamics of the Earth. We evaluate how well upper-mantle thermal structure can be inferred from seismic velocities. Our forward calculation of seismic velocities and density includes uncertainties in anharmonic and anelastic parameters for various compositional models. The sensitivity of VP (VS) to temperature along a 1300 {$^{\circ}$}C adiabat decreases with depth from -0.75 $\pm$ 0.15{\%} (1.3 $\pm$ 0.30{\%}) per 100 {$^{\circ}$}C at 200 km, to -0.23 $\pm$ 0.05{\%} (-0.45 $\pm$ 0.10{\%}) per 100 {$^{\circ}$}C at 800 km, with an additional reduction in the wadsleyite stability zone. Shear anelasticity introduces a significant non-linear dependence of seismic velocities on temperature in the upper-mantle. This means that seismic anomalies with similar amplitudes but different signs correspond to temperature anomalies of a different magnitude, and absolute seismic velocities are required for making a thermal interpretation. With depth, the importance of anelasticity decreases. Temperature derivatives of bulk sound velocity (V$\phi$) and density ($\rho$) are a factor two to five lower than those of VP,S and do not depend strongly on temperature. Common mantle compositions cause velocity anomalies of about 1{\%} throughout the upper-mantle. Above 400 km depth, the effect of composition on VP and VS is secondary to the effect of temperature, but it gains importance with increasing depth. For most upper-mantle compositions and depths, the relative sensitivity of VP, VS and V$\phi$ to temperature and composition is not different enough to distinguish the two factors from combined velocity models. But $\partial$ ln $\rho$/$\partial$ln VS allows a separation of thermal anomalies from compositional anomalies for iron-depleted and subducted material. Spherically symmetric reference profiles underlie most seismic velocity models. However, small differences between common one-dimensional velocity models translate into disparate thermal interpretations. A better understanding of seismic uncertainties and the physical interpretation of reference models is necessary to interpret absolute velocities. Assuming seismic structure is well resolved and composition known, uncertainties in inferred thermal structure are $\pm$100 {$^{\circ}$}C above 400 km depth and $\pm$250 {$^{\circ}$}C in the shallow lower-mantle. This makes an inversion of seismic velocity models for temperature feasible, above 400 km depth. At larger depths, testing seismic velocities calculated for a proposed thermal and compositional structure against observations is a more promising interpretation approach. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {Imposing a thermal and compositional significance to the outcome of the inversion of seismic data facilitates their interpretation. Using long-period seismic waveforms and an inversion approach that includes constraints from mineral physics, we find that lateral variations of temperature can explain a large part of the data in the upper mantle. The additional compositional signature of cratons emerges in the global model as well. Above 300 km, we obtain seismic geotherms that span the range of expected temperatures in various tectonic regions. Absolute velocities and gradients with depth are well constrained by the seismic data throughout the upper mantle, except near discontinuities. The seismic data are consistent with a slower transition zone and an overall faster shallow upper mantle, which is not compatible with a homogenous dry pyrolite composition. A gradual enrichment with depth in a garnet-rich component helps to reduce the observed discrepancies. A hydrated transition zone would help to lower the velocities in the transition zone, but it does not explain the seismic structure above it.},

  abstract     = {Mapping the thermal and compositional structure of the upper mantle requires a combined interpretation of geophysical and petrological observations. Based on current knowledge of material properties, we interpret available global seismic models for temperature assuming end-member compositional structures. In particular, we test the effects of modelling a depleted lithosphere, which accounts for petrological constraints on continents. Differences between seismic models translate into large temperature and density variations, respectively, up to 400 K and 0.06 g cm-3 at 150 km depth. Introducing lateral compositional variations does not change significantly the thermal interpretation of seismic models, but gives a more realistic density structure. Modelling a petrological lithosphere gives cratonic temperatures at 150 km depth that are only 100 K hotter than those obtained assuming pyrolite, but density is {\~{}}0.1 g cm-3 lower. We determined the geoid and topography associated with the density distributions by computing the instantaneous flow with an existing code of mantle convection, STAG-YY. Models with and without lateral variations in viscosity have been tested. We found that the differences between seismic models in the deeper part of the upper mantle significantly affect the global geoid, even at harmonic degree 2. The range of variance reduction for geoid due to differences in the transition zone structure (i.e. from 410 to 660 km) is comparable with the range due to differences in the whole mantle seismic structure. Since geoid is dominated by very long wavelengths (the lowest five harmonic degrees account for more than 90 per cent of the signal power), the lithospheric density contrasts do not strongly affect its overall pattern. Models that include a petrological lithosphere, however, fit the geoid and topography better. Most of the long-wavelength contribution that helps to improve the fit comes from the oceanic lithosphere. The signature of continental lithosphere worsens the fit, even in simulations that assume an extremely viscous lithosphere. Therefore, a less depleted, and thus less buoyant, continental lithosphere is required to explain gravity data. None of the seismic tomography models we analyse is able to reproduce accurately the thermal structure of the oceanic lithosphere. All of them show their lowest seismic velocities at {\~{}}100 km depth beneath mid-oceanic ridges and have much higher velocities at shallower depths compared to what is predicted with standard cooling models. Despite the limited resolution of global seismic models, this seems to suggest the presence of an additional compositional complexity in the lithosphere.},

Here we analyse the plate motions involved in two apparently disparate events--the unusually rapid motion of India between 67 and 52 million years ago and a contemporaneous, transitory slowing of Africa's motion--and show that the events are coupled, with the common element being the position of the Indian and African plates relative to the location of the R{\'{e}}union plume head. The synchroneity of these events suggests that they were both driven by the force of the R{\'{e}}union plume head. The recognition of this plume force has substantial tectonic implications: the speed-up and slowdown of India, the possible cessation of convergence between Africa and Eurasia in the Palaeocene epoch and the enigmatic bends of the fracture zones on the Southwest Indian Ridge can all be attributed to the R{\'{e}}union plume.},

Measurements from this region also provide important input and/or tests of oceanic radiocarbon using 3-D global ocean circulation models. Here, we present a surface water radiocarbon reservoir age record of the high latitude western North Atlantic for the deglacial period via the use of fossil cold-water corals growing in waters that are rapidly exchanged with nearby surface waters. The reservoir age of high latitude North Atlantic surface waters was computed from the radiocarbon age difference between our radiocarbon calibration record (http://radiocarbon.LDEO.columbia.edu) and our marine radiocarbon data.

Our high latitude North Atlantic Ocean reservoir age data combined with recalculated reservoir ages based on published coexisting terrestrial and marine material and Vedde ash radiocarbon dates from central and eastern North Atlantic show modern values (380??140 year, n=14) during the Bolling and Allerod warm period and a 200 year increase in reservoir age (590??130 year, n=10) during the entire Younger Dryas (YD) cold episode. The reservoir age then decreased to 270??20 year (n=2) at the Preboreal/YD transition, although the dates are too sparse for us to be confident in this estimate.

Here, we use terrestrial and marine records of the deglaciation to identify two periods of rapid melting during the final demise of the Laurentide ice sheet, when melting ice contributed about 1.3 and 0.7 cm of sea level rise per year, respectively. Our simulations with a fully coupled ocean--atmosphere model suggest that increased ablation due to enhanced early Holocene boreal summer insolation was the predominant cause of Laurentide ice-sheet retreat. Although the surface radiative forcing in boreal summer during the early Holocene is twice as large as the greenhouse-gas forcing expected by the year 2100, the associated increase in summer surface air temperatures is very similar. We conclude that our geologic evidence for a rapid retreat of the Laurentide ice sheet may therefore describe a prehistoric precedent for mass balance changes of the Greenland ice sheet over the coming century.},

However, the relative severity of individual episodes and impact on fluid dynamics within the basin are poorly constrained. We apply basin modelling tools to establish the sensitivity of the petroleum system to three cited scenarios for Cenozoic exhumation. Vitrinite reflectance and temperature data constrain burial and thermal histories. Calibration is not possible using heat flow variations alone; erosion timing and magnitude are required to match available data. The calibrated model indicates a significant thermal disequilibrium in the Hammerfest Basin at the present day resulting from Late Cenozoic exhumation. Forward modelling of Pleistocene ice sheets allows for an estimation of pressure and temperature fluctuations in response to glacial-interglacial cycles.},

  abstract     = {Continental crust is the archive of Earth history. The spatial and temporal distribution of Earth's record of rock units and events is heterogeneous; for example, ages of igneous crystallization, metamorphism, continental margins, mineralization, and sea water and atmospheric proxies are distributed about a series of peaks and troughs. This distribution refl ects the different preservation potential of rocks generated in different tectonic settings, rather than fundamental pulses of activity, and the peaks of ages are linked to the timing of supercontinent assembly. The physiochemical resilience of zircons and their derivation largely from felsic igneous rocks means that they are important indicators of the crustal record. Furthermore, detrital zircons, which sample a range of source rocks, provide a more representative record than direct analysis of grains in igneous rocks. Analysis of detrital zircons suggests that at least {\~{}}60{\%}--70{\%} of the present volume of the continental crust had been generated by 3 Ga. Such estimates seek to take account of the extent to which the old crustal material is underrepresented in the sedimentary record , and they imply that there were greater volumes of continental crust in the Archean than might be inferred from the compositions of detrital zircons and sediments. The growth of continental crust was a continuous rather than an episodic process, but there was a marked decrease in the rate of crustal growth at ca. 3 Ga, which may have been linked to the onset of signifi cant crustal recycling, probably through subduction at convergent plate margins. The Hadean and Early Archean continental record is poorly preserved and characterized by a bimodal TTG (tonalites, trondhjemites, and granodiorites) and greenstone association that differs from the younger record that can be more directly related to a plate-tectonic regime. The paucity of this early record has led to competing and equivocal models invoking plate-tectonic-- and mantle-plume--dominated processes. The 60{\%}--70{\%} of the present volume of the continental crust estimated to have been present at 3 Ga contrasts markedly with the {\textless}10{\%} of crust of that age apparently still preserved and requires on going destruction (recycling) of crust and subconti nental mantle lithosphere back into the mantle through processes such as subduction and delamination.},

A variety of published models exist but none completely solve the tectonic puzzle that is the Delamerian-Lachlan transition in the Tasmanides. This paper summarizes the understanding of Cambrian (Delamerian) to Silurian (Lachlan) geological evolution of the eastern Tasmanides, taking into account new deep seismic data that clarifies the geological connection between Victoria and Tasmania - the 'Selwyn Block' model. It evaluates previous attempts at correlation between NVL, Tasmania and Victoria, and presents a new scenario that encompasses the most robust correlations. Tasmania together with the Selwyn Block is reinterpreted as an exotic Proterozoic microcontinental block - 'VanDieland' - that collided into the east Gondwanaland margin south of western Victoria, and north of NVL in the Late Cambrian, perhaps terminating the Delamerian Orogeny in SE Australia. Subsequent north-east 'tectonic escape' of VanDieland in the Early Ordovician explains the present-day outboard position of Tasmania with respect to the rest of the Delamerian orogen, the origin of the hiatus that separates the Delamerian and Lachlan orogenic cycles in Australia, and how western Lachlan oceanic crust developed as a 'trapped plate-segment'. The model establishes a new structural template for subsequent Lachlan Orogen development and Mesozoic Australia-Antarctica separation. ?? 2010.},

In this region, we modelled the gas hydrate stability field in a 3D perspective, including the effects of higher order hydrocarbon gases. We used 3D seismic data to analyse the linkage between fluid-flow expressions and hydrate occurrences above old sedimentary basin systems and vertical faults. Pockmarks showed a relation to fault systems where some of them are directly connected to hydrocarbon bearing sedimentary formations. The influence of bottom water temperature, pore water salinity and geothermal gradient variation on gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) thickness is critically analysed in relation to both geological formations and salt tectonics. Our analysis suggests a highly variable GHSZ in the Barents Sea region controlled by local variations in the parameters of stability conditions. Recovery of gas-hydrate sample from the region and presence of gas-enhanced reflections below estimated BSR depths may indicate a prevalent gas-hydrate stable condition. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that complications arising from ice sheet multiples can be effectively managed and further information concerning low-velocity subglacial sediment thickness may be determined, via top-down utilization of synthetic receiver function models. We combine shallow structure constraints with the response of deeper layers using a regularized Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology to constrain bulk crustal properties. Crustal thickness estimates range from 17.0$\pm$4 km at Fishtail Point in the western WARS to 45$\pm$5 km at Lonewolf Nunataks in the TAM. Symmetric regions of crustal thinning observed in a transect deployment across the West Antarctic Ice Sheet correlate with deep subice basins, consistent with pure shear crustal necking under past localized extension. Subglacial sediment deposit thicknesses generally correlate with trough/dome expectations, with the thickest inferred subice low-velocity sediment estimated as $\sim$0.4 km within the Bentley Subglacial Trench. Inverted PRFs from this study and other published crustal estimates are combined with ambient noise surface wave constraints to generate a crustal thickness map for West Antarctica south of 75{$^{\circ}$}S. Observations are consistent with isostatic crustal compensation across the central WARS but indicate significant mantle compensation across the TAM, Ellsworth Block, MBL dome, and eastern and western sectors of thinnest WARS crust, consistent with low density and likely dynamic, low-viscosity high-temperature mantle.},

Our analysis of the geomagnetic reversal frequency, oxygen isotope record, and tectonic plate subduction rate, which are indicators of the changes in the heat flux at the core mantle boundary, climate and plate tectonic activity, shows that all these changes indicate similar rhythms on million years' timescale in the Cenozoic Era occurring with the common fundamental periodicity of {\~{}}13 Myr during most of the time. The periodicity is disrupted only during the last 20 Myr. Such periodic behavior suggests that large scale climate and tectonic changes at the Earth's surface are closely connected with the million year timescale cyclical reorganization of the Earth's interior.},

  abstract     = {Seismic traveltime tomography is commonly discretized by a truncated expansion of the pursued model in terms of chosen basis functions. Whether parametrization affects the actual resolving power of a given data set as well as the robustness of the resulting earth model has long been seriously debated. From the perspective of the model resolution, however, there is one important aspect of the parametrization issue of seismic tomography that has yet to be systematically explored, that is, the space--frequency localization of a chosen parametrization. In fact, the two most common parametrizations tend to enforce resolution in each of their own particular domains. Namely, parametrization in terms of{~}spherical harmonics with global support tends to emphasize spectral resolution while sacrificing the spatial resolution, whereas the compactly supported pixels tend to behave in the opposite manner. Some of the significant discrepancies among tomographic models are very likely to be manifestations of this effect, when dealing with data sets with non-uniform sampling. With an example of the tomographic inversion for the lateral shear wave heterogeneity of the D$\prime\prime$ layer using S--SKS traveltimes, we demonstrate{~}an{~}alternative parametrization in terms of the multiresolution representation of the pursued model function. Unlike previous attempts of multiscale inversion that invoke pixels with{~}variable sizes, or overlay several layers of tessellation with different grid intervals, our formulation invokes biorthogonal generalized Harr wavelets on a sphere. We show that multiresolution representation can be constructed very easily from an existing block-based discretization. A natural scale hierarchy of the pursued model structure constrained by the resolving power of the given sampling is embedded within the solution obtained. It provides a natural regularization scheme based on the actual ray-path sampling and is thus free from a priori prejudices intrinsic to most regularization schemes. Unlike solutions obtained through spherical harmonics or spherical blocks that tend to collapse structures onto ray paths, our parametrization imposes regionally varying Nyquist limits, that is, robustly resolvable local wavelength bands within the obtained solution.},

Of these three, it is believed that the field intensity is the dominant factor. We analyze an atmospheric ??14C record spanning the past 50,000 years based on previously-published 230\textsuperscript{Th}/234U/238U and 14C dates of fossil corals from Kiritimati, Barbados, Araki and Santo Islands, and identify the role of the Laschamp geomagnetic field excursion on the long term trend of the ??14C record. There is a general consistency between the coral ??14C record and the ??14C output from carbon cycle models based on the global 14C production estimates. High-precision, high-accuracy 230\textsuperscript{Th}/234U/238U dates and redundant 231Pa/235U dates anchor the timing of this ??14C record. We propose that a significant fraction of the long-term ??14C trend may be due to inaccuracies in the generally accepted 14C decay constant. The uncertainty in estimating the shape of 14C beta spectrum below 20 keV leads to one of the greatest errors in decay constant estimates. Once the 14C half-life is validated via redundant techniques, ??14C records will provide a better opportunity to examine the roles of carbon cycle and 14C production influences. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract     = {Fossil coral is an excellent archive to extend the radiocarbon ( 14C) calibration beyond tree-ring records; however, published coral data older than 26,000 years before present are too disparate for practical calibration. We propose an explanation for these discrepancies: trace amounts of secondary calcite and organic matter in fossil corals shift the 14C ages toward younger ages. In a series of acid-leaching experiments to simulate the standard cleaning procedure prior to 14C analysis, we measure up to a 300{\%} enrichment of diagenetic calcite in corals due to the solubility differences between calcite and aragonite. In model calculations, we show the 14C age offsets produced by acid leaching could be hundreds to thousands of years when typical amounts of calcite are present in samples. We demonstrate the necessity and our ability to detect {\textless}0.2{\%} calcite in aragonite by X-ray diffraction and apply "{\textless}0.2{\%} calcite" as our a priori criterion for our coral samples. The estimated age offsets of samples with {\textless}0.2{\%} calcite fall within the reported analytical uncertainty of 14C dating. In addition, we present 14C results from an extended hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) pretreatment for coral samples to remove organic matter. Our data show that treated samples yield consistent or older 14C dates compared to non-treated samples. These rigorous but necessary screening and cleaning techniques provide precise, reproducible and accurate radiocarbon calibration data. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {The foreground of Elisebreen, a retreating valley glacier in West Svalbard, exhibits a well-preserved assemblage of subglacial landforms including ice-flow parallel ridges (flutings), ice-flow oblique ridges (crevasse-fill features), and meandering ridges (infill of basal meltwater conduits). Other landforms are thrust-block moraine, hummocky terrain, and drumlinoid hills. We argue in agreement with geomorphological models that this landform assemblage was generated by ice-flow instability, possibly a surge, which took place in the past when the ice was thicker and the bed warmer. The surge likely occurred due to elevated pore-water pressure in a thin layer of thawed and water-saturated till that separated glacier ice from a frozen substratum. Termination may have been caused by a combination of water drainage and loss of lubricating sediment. Sedimentological investigations indicate that key landforms may be formed by weak till oozing into basal cavities and crevasses, opening in response to accelerated ice flow, and into water conduits abandoned during rearrangement of the basal water system. Today, Elisebreen may no longer have surge potential due to its diminished size. The ability to identify ice-flow instability from geomorphological criteria is important in deglaciated terrain as well as in regions where ice dynamics are adapting to climate change. ?? 2005 University of Washington.

  abstract     = {A recent focus of major international exploration in East Antarctica has been aimed at revealing its bedrock topography and imaging its tectonic architecture and evolution. Here we present the tectonic interpretation of regional-scale lineaments revealed by the Radarsat mosaic of Antarctica on the ice sheet surface in the Vostok--Dome C--Adventure Basin region. These lineaments appear in the radar backscatter textures as alignments of marked tonal variations with lengths of tens to hundreds of kilometers and were identified using an automated methodology. We explore the origin scenarios for the ice sheet surface lineaments by comparing their azimuthal trends and spatial distribution with the main morphotectonic features of the bedrock. Azimuthal analysis reveals that lineaments cluster around two preferential directions interpreted as structural or tectonic domains. These show strong correlations with azimuths of tectonic fabrics in the bedrock. The main lineament domain parallels the morphotectonic features of the study area, namely the Adventure Basin and the Concordia and Aurora Trenches. The second lineament set corresponds to the mean orientation of the Lake Vostok depression. The spatial analyses of the two lineament domains strengthen our findings and interpretations. Comparisons with wind and ice flow directions exclude their influence on the identified lineament pattern. Results reveal the tectonic origin of the lineament domains, and demonstrate the method's usefulness as a tool for tectonic studies of regions characterized by thick covers. These regions include other areas of the East Antarctic craton such as the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains, as well as deserts or surfaces of other planets.},

  abstract     = {Mega-scale glacial lineations (MSGLs) are longitudinally aligned corrugations (ridge-groove structures 6-100 km long) in sediment produced subglacially. They are indicators of fast flow and a common signature of ice-stream beds. We develop a qualitative theory that accounts for their formation, and use numerical modelling, and observations of ice-stream beds to provide supporting evidence. Ice in contact with a rough (scale of 10-10(3) m) bedrock surface will mimic the form of the bed. Because of flow acceleration and convergence in ice-stream onset zones, the ice-base roughness elements experience transverse strain, transforming them from irregular bumps into longitudinally aligned keels of ice protruding downwards. Where such keels slide across a soft sedimentary bed, they plough through the sediments, carving elongate grooves, and deforming material up into intervening ridges. This explains MSGLs and has important implications for ice-stream mechanics. Groove ploughing provides the means to acquire new lubricating sediment and to transport large volumes of it downstream. Keels may provide basal drag in the force budget of ice streams, thereby playing a role in flow regulation and stability We speculate that groove ploughing permits significant ice-stream widening, thus facilitating high-magnitude ice discharge.},

Growth of the ice sheets to their maximum positions occurred between 33.0 and 26.5 ka in response to climate forcing from decreases in northern summer insolation, tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures, and atmospheric CO2. Nearly all ice sheets were at their LGM positions from 26.5 ka to 19 to 20 ka, corresponding to minima in these forcings. The onset of Northern Hemisphere deglaciation 19 to 20 ka was induced by an increase in northern summer insolation, providing the source for an abrupt rise in sea level.

The differential subsidence initiated movements in the mobile Zechstein Salt, causing deformation of the cover sediments. The variability in differential subsidence observed during the Triassic along the southern margin of the Ringkobing-Fyn High is interpreted to reflect the subdivision of the Ringkobing-Fyn High into a number of structure blocks.},

  abstract     = {More than a decade ago, ice core records from Greenland revealed that the last glacial period was characterized by abrupt climate changes that recurred on millennial time scales. Since their discovery, there has been a large effort to determine whether these climate events were a global phenomenon or were just confined to the North Atlantic region and also to reveal the mechanisms that were responsible for them. In this paper, we review the available paleoclimate observations of abrupt change during the last glacial period in order to place constraints on possible mechanisms. Three different mechanisms are then reviewed: ocean thermohaline circulation, sea ice feedbacks, and tropical processes. Each mechanism is tested for its ability to explain the key features of the observations, particularly with regard to the abruptness, millennial recurrence, and geographical extent of the observed changes. It is found that each of these mechanisms has explanatory strengths and weaknesses, and key areas in which progress could be made in improving the understanding of their long-term behavior, both from observational and modeling approaches, are suggested. Finally, it is proposed that a complete understanding of the mechanisms of abrupt change requires inclusion of processes at both low and high latitudes, as well as the potential for feedbacks between them. Some suggestions for experimental approaches to test for such feedbacks with coupled climate models are given.},

  abstract  = {Based on the tectonic setting and slow seismic velocities in the upper mantle, the geothermal heat flow beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is expected to be both relatively high and spatially variable. Unfortunately, very few heat flow measurements have been made in West Antarctica to confirm or refute this expectation. During December 2011, high-precision temperature measurements were made in the 3405-m deep borehole recently completed at the WAIS Divide ice core site (79o 28.059'S, 112o 05.137'W) in the central portion of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Interpretation of the temperature measurements indicates the ice sheet is melted at the bed at this location and that the basal melting rate is extraordinarily high, 1.5~cm a-1 (the borehole does not penetrate all the way to the bed to protect the underlying environment). The associated geothermal heat flux is estimated to be about 240 mW m-2, 4--5 times the continental average. Given the absence of a surface depression at the WAIS Divide site, this high heat flow is likely to be the regional value (horizontal scale $\geq$ 30~km), rather than simply a local anomaly.},

  abstract     = {Equation-of-state (EOS) modeling, whereby the seismic properties of a specified thermochemical structure are constructed from mineral physics constraints, and compared with global seismic data, provides a potentially powerful tool for distinguishing between plausible mantle structures. However, previous such studies at lower mantle depths have been hampered by insufficient evaluation of mineral physics uncertainties, overestimation of seismic uncertainties, or biases in the type of seismic and/or mineral physics data used. This has led to a wide, often conflicting, variety of models being proposed for the average lower mantle structure. In this study, we perform a thorough reassessment of mineral physics and seismic data uncertainties. Uncertainties in both the type of EOS, and mineral elastic parameters, used are taken into account. From this analysis, it is evident that the seismic variability due to these uncertainties is predominantly controlled by only a small subset of the mineral parameters. Furthermore, although adiabatic pyrolite cannot be ruled out completely, it is problematic to explain seismic velocities and gradients at all depth intervals with such a structure, especially in the interval 1660--2000 km. We therefore consider a range of alternative thermal and chemical structures, and map out the sensitivity of average seismic velocities and gradients to deviations in temperature and composition. Compositional sensitivity is tested both in terms of plausible end-member compositions (e.g., MORB, chondrite), and via changes in each of the five major mantle oxides, SiO2, MgO, FeO, CaO, and Al2O3. Fe enrichment reduces both P and S velocities significantly, while Si enrichment (and Mg depletion) increases P and S velocities, with a larger increase in P than in S. Using purely thermal deviations from adiabatic pyrolite, it remains difficult to explain simultaneously all seismic observations. A superadiabatic temperature gradient does improve the seismic fit in the lowermost mantle, but should be accompanied by concurrent bulk chemistry changes. Our results suggest that the most plausible way to alter bulk chemistry in the lowermost mantle, simultaneously fitting density, bulk velocity and shear velocity constraints, is an increasing contribution of a hot, basalt-enriched component with depth.},

  abstract     = {Regional seismic studies of the Earth's deep mantle indicate the presence of P-and S-wave reflectors at the top of the D" layer. Such reflectors appear to be laterally intermittent, occur at a range of depths, and produce waveforms whose amplitude and polarity differ at different locations. A number of possible explanations for D" reflections have been proposed, including: a phase change from perovskite to post-perovskite; thermal or thermochemical discontinuities generated by subducted slabs; alignment of anisotropic minerals and global or small-scale chemical heterogeneity arising perhaps from core-mantle interactions or primitive material. However, some of the observed heterogeneity in D" structure may be related to lack of consistency between the style, quality and number of seismic observations in different regions, as well as complexity in wave propagation due to 3-D structure. In this study, we present a compilation of observations of D" reflections for regions in which (1) a reflector is seen in both P-and S-wave arrivals and (2) consistent array seismology techniques have been applied to infer the properties of the reflectors. Using a recent Monte Carlo thermodynamic modelling method to convert changes in chemistry and mineralogy into changes in seismic velocity, we compare the fit of different isotropic thermochemical structures to the observed seismic properties of D" reflections, namely the polarity and amplitude of the waveforms. Our results indicate that it may be possible to discriminate between different possible origins for D" reflections on the basis of polarity observations alone. Amplitude measurements may provide further constraints but must be treated with caution due to a large number of factors, which can influence waveform amplitudes. In regions such as the Caribbean, which are characterized by high-amplitude, negative polarity P waveforms and positive polarity S waveforms, a phase change from perovskite to post-perovskite provides the most likely explanation for the discontinuity. However, in other regions, notably Siberia and the central Pacific, P-and S waveforms both display a positive polarity, and multiple explanations for the discontinuity are possible, including subduction-related chemical heterogeneity and anisotropy. {\textcopyright} The Authors 2013.},

  abstract     = {Large igneous provinces (LIPs) are a continuum of voluminous iron and magnesium rich rock emplacements which include continental flood basalts and associated intrusive rocks, volcanic passive margins, oceanic plateaus, submarine ridges, seamount groups, and ocean basin flood basalts. Such provinces do not originate at {\textquotedblleft}normal{\textquotedblright} seafloor spreading centers. We compile all known in situ LIPs younger than 250 Ma and analyze dimensions, crustal structures, ages, and emplacement rates of representatives of the three major LIP categories: Ontong Java and Kerguelen-Broken Ridge oceanic plateaus, North Atlantic volcanic passive margins, and Deccan and Columbia River continental flood basalts. Crustal thicknesses range from 20 to 40 km, and the lower crust is characterized by high (7.0-7.6 km s$-$1) compressional wave velocities. Volumes and emplacement rates derived for the two giant oceanic plateaus, Ontong Java and Kerguelen, reveal short-lived pulses of increased global production; Ontong Java's rate of emplacement may have exceeded the contemporaneous global production rate of the entire mid-ocean ridge system. The major part of the North Atlantic volcanic province lies offshore and demonstrates that volcanic passive margins belong in the global LIP inventory. Deep crustal intrusive companions to continental flood volcanism represent volumetrically significant contributions to the crust. We envision a complex mantle circulation which must account for a variety of LIP sizes, the largest originating in the lower mantle and smaller ones developing in the upper mantle. This circulation coexists with convection associated with plate tectonics, a complicated thermal structure, and at least four distinct geochemical/isotopic reservoirs. LIPs episodically alter ocean basin, continental margin, and continental geometries and affect the chemistry and physics of the oceans and atmosphere with enormous potential environmental impact. Despite the importance of LIPs in studies of mantle dynamics and global environment, scarce age and deep crustal data necessitate intensified efforts in seismic imaging and scientific drilling in a range of such features.},

  abstract     = {An algorithm for the construction of phase diagram sections is formulated that is well suited for geodynamic problems in which it is necessary to assess the influence of phase transitions on rock properties or the evolution and migration of fluids. The basis of the algorithm is the representation of the continuous compositional variations of solution phases by series of discrete compositions. As a consequence of this approximation the classical non-linear free energy minimization problem is trivially solved by linear programming. Phase relations are then mapped as a function of the variables of interest using bisection to locate phase boundaries. Treatment of isentropic and isothermal phase relations involving felsic and mafic silicate melts by this method is illustrated. To demonstrate the tractability of more complex problems involving mass transfer, a model for infiltration driven-decarbonation in subduction zones is evaluated. As concluded from earlier closed system models, the open-system model indicates that carbonates are likely to persist in the subducted oceanic crust beyond sub-arc depths even if the upper section of the oceanic mantle is extensively hydrated. However, in contrast to more simplistic models of slab devolatilization, the open-system model suggests slab fluid production is heterogeneous and ephemeral. Computed seismic velocity profiles, together with thermodynamic constraints, imply that for typical geothermal conditions serpentinization of the subducted mantle is unlikely to extend to {\textgreater} 25 km depth and that the average water-content of the serpentinized mantle is {\textless} 2 wt.{\%}. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Lateral viscosity variations generally do not change the direction of shear tractions, but deeply penetrating continental roots increase traction magnitudes by a factor of 2-5 compared to 100 km thick lithosphere. A low-viscosity asthenosphere decreases traction magnitudes by a smaller amount, and is important only if {\textgreater}100 km thick. Increased plate-mantle coupling beneath thick continental lithosphere may increase plate-driving forces, surface deformation, and mantle-derived lithospheric stresses in these regions. By contrast, a low-viscosity asthenosphere does not decouple the lithosphere from mantle flow, highlighting the geological importance of mantle tractions on the lithosphere.},

  abstract     = {Glacimarine sediment deposited in the fjord adjacent to Muir Glacier in south-eastern Alaska consists of rhythmically laminated muds, stratified sandy mud, sand and gravelly mud facies. Cyclicity is recorded by gravelly mud facies deposited during winter by ice-rafting, black mud laminae formed by spring plankton blooms and variations in tidal rhythmite thickness and texture produced by the interaction of meltwater discharges and tidal currents in the macrotidal fjord. Regular cyclicity in laminae thickness is tested statistically by Fourier transform and can be attributed to a lunar tidal cycle control in the five cores collected up to 6 km from the sediment source. Cores close to the source can have additional laminae as a result of discharge fluctuations, and distal cores may lack full cycles because of variability in the plume path and attenuation with distance. Cyclic variations in sediment texture are recorded in magnetic susceptibility (MS) profiles of the cores. High MS values are produced by turbidite sand beds or by stratified sandy mud deposited by overflow plumes during peak summer meltwater discharge. Low values reflect muddy intervals deposited during periods of low meltwater discharge, such as during autumn and winter. Sediment accumulation rates measured by Pb-210 dating range from 82 cm year(-1), 2 km from the sediment source at the head of the fjord, to 16 cm year(-1), 6 km away. These rates are within the same range as average sediment accumulation rates determined from cyclic seasonal markers within the cores. These data show that, with careful documentation, annual cycles of glacimarine sediment accumulation can be detected within marine cores. Cores collected from the distal portion of the basin were deposited during the transition of Muir Glacier from a tidewater terminus ending in deep water to a terrestrial glacier with an ice-contact delta deposited in front of the terminus. This transition is recorded by a coarsening-upward sedimentary sequence formed by turbidite sands originating from the prograding delta above fine-grained, laminated basin fill deposited by turbid overflow plumes.},

It is difficult to evaluate this contribution to fault loading because it is unclear whether the viscous deformation occurs in localized shear zones or is more broadly distributed2. Furthermore, the rate of strain accumulation by viscous flow has a power law dependence on the stress applied, yet there are few direct estimates of what the power law exponent is, over the long term, for active faults. Here we measure topography and the offset along fault surfaces created during successive episodes of slip on seismically active extensional faults in the Italian Apennines during the Holocene epoch. We show that these data can be used to derive a relationship between the stress driving deformation and the fault strain rate, averaged over about 15 thousand years (kyr). We find that this relationship follows a well-defined power law with an exponent in the range of 3.0--3.3 (1$\sigma$). This exponent is consistent with nonlinear viscous deformation in the deep crust and, crucially, strain localization promoted by seismogenic faulting at shallower depths. Although we cannot rule out some distributed deformation, we suggest that fault strain and thus earthquake recurrence in the Apennines is largely controlled by viscous flow in deep, localized shear zones, over many earthquake cycles.},

Hence, there is much scope for the application of MLAs to the rapidly increasing volumes of remotely sensed geophysical data for geological mapping problems. We carry out a rigorous comparison of five MLAs: Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Artificial Neural Networks, in the context of a supervised lithology classification task using widely available and spatially constrained remotely sensed geophysical data. We make a further comparison of MLAs based on their sensitivity to variations in the degree of spatial clustering of training data, and their response to the inclusion of explicit spatial information (spatial coordinates). Our work identifies Random Forests as a good first choice algorithm for the supervised classification of lithology using remotely sensed geophysical data. Random Forests is straightforward to train, computationally efficient, highly stable with respect to variations in classification model parameter values, and as accurate as, or substantially more accurate than the other MLAs trialed. The results of our study indicate that as training data becomes increasingly dispersed across the region under investigation, MLA predictive accuracy improves dramatically. The use of explicit spatial information generates accurate lithology predictions but should be used in conjunction with geophysical data in order to generate geologically plausible predictions. MLAs, such as Random Forests, are valuable tools for generating reliable first-pass predictions for practical geological mapping applications that combine widely available geophysical data. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

Radiocarbon dates of remains of freshwater plants and bulk organic carbon extracted from lacustrine sediments suggest that the present day ice-free parts of eastern Greenland were not deglaciated prior to the early Holocene. Older dates do exist but must be used with caution due to possible contamination with old carbon. However, many inland locations in eastern North and central East Greenland became ice-free distinctly later between 10,000 and 7500 cal yr BP, depending on their relative position to the ice margin. This compilation confirms former suggestions that hitherto no secure Late glacial lacustrine sediments have been found in the ice-free parts of eastern Greenland. Late glacial sediments are only known from lakes in southern Greenland and from few marine locations off eastern Greenland. The here summarized lake sediment evidence for the last deglaciation supports the results of an earlier compilation of dates from marine shells. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {This study is based on rock mechanical tests of samples from platform carbonate strata to document their petrophysical properties and determine their potential for porosity loss by mechanical compaction. Sixteen core-plug samples, including eleven limestones and five dolostones, from Miocene carbonate platforms on the Marion Plateau, offshore northeast Australia, were tested at vertical effective stress, $\sigma$1$\prime$, of 0-70MPa, as lateral strain was kept equal to zero. The samples were deposited as bioclastic facies in platform-top settings having paleo-water depths of {\textless}10-90m. They were variably cemented with low-Mg calcite and five of the samples were dolomitized before burial to present depths of 39-635m below sea floor with porosities of 8-46{\%}. Ten samples tested under dry conditions had up to 0.22{\%} strain at $\sigma$1$\prime$=50MPa, whereas six samples tested saturated with brine, under drained conditions, had up to 0.33{\%} strain. The yield strength was reached in five of the plugs. The measured strains show an overall positive correlation with porosity. Vp ranges from 3640 to 5660m/s and Vs from 1840 to 3530m/s. Poisson coefficient is 0.20-0.33 and Young's modulus at 30MPa ranged between 5 and 40 GPa. Water saturated samples had lower shear moduli and slightly higher P- to S-wave velocity ratios. Creep at constant stress was observed only in samples affected by pore collapse, indicating propagation of microcracks. Although deposited as loose carbonate sand and mud, the studied carbonates acquired reef-like petrophysical properties by early calcite and dolomite cementation. The small strains observed experimentally at 50MPa indicate that little mechanical compaction would occur at deeper burial. However, as these rocks are unlikely to preserve their present high porosities to 4-5 km depth, further porosity loss would proceed mainly by chemical compaction and cementation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract     = {Geochronologic data from the southern margins of the Colorado Plateau (western United States) show an inboard radial migration of Neogene basaltic magmatism. Nd and Sr isotopic data show that as basaltic volcanism migrates inboard it also becomes increasingly more asthenospheric. Strongly asthenospheric alkali basalt (epsilon(Nd) {\textgreater} 4) appeared on the western plateau margin ca. 5 Ma, on the southeastern margin at 7 Ma, and is lacking from the plateau's other margins. Tomographic data suggest that low-velocity mantle underlies almost all recent (younger than 1 Ma) basaltic volcanism in a ring around much of the Colorado Plateau at a depth of 80 km. The combined isotopic and tomographic data indicate that the low-velocity mantle is asthenosphere along the western and southeastern margins of the plateau, but modified lithosphere around the remaining margins. Temporal and spatial patterns suggest a process by which upwelling asthenosphere is progressively infiltrating and replacing lithospheric mantle, especially where Proterozoic boundaries exist. This model explains (1) the dramatic velocity contrast seen well inboard of the physiographic edge of the plateau, (2) the inboard sweep of Neogene magmatism, and (3) isotopic evidence that much (but not all) of the low-velocity mantle is asthenospheric. These data support models that ongoing uplift of the edges of the Colorado Plateau is driven by mantle processes.},

In particular, the trimline indicating margin retreat since the maximum stand attained during the Little Ice Age maximum is reconstructed, and compared with earlier maps based on aerial photogrammetry and ground surveys. Applying supervised classification, fourteen different surface types were identified, ranging from snow and ice, debris-covered ice and water with differing turbidities, to different types of vegetative landcover. After similar classes were merged into five, distinctively different classes, a digitized geomorphologic map was used to assess the accuracy of the classification. The positional accuracy of the trimline was checked by using results from a GPS survey along northern slope of the Jakobshavn fjord. By merging three spectral bands with the panchromatic band, a pan-sharpened image with a spatial resolution of 15{\^{A}} m is obtained that clearly shows morphological features on the ice surface, as well as increased resolution of glacial geomorphology.},

Analyses of marine geophysical data still lead to seemingly unacceptable overlap between the Antarctic Peninsula and the South American continent or else to geologically questionable relationships. A review of the relevant geological and geophysical data indicates that the problem lies in microplate movement and crustal thinning within West Antarctica during Gondwanaland breakup in the late Mesozoic and Cenozoic. The available data allow a range of possible reconstructions with West Antarctica subdivided into several discrete or semidiscrete microplates. Final solution of this problem requires additional geological and, particularly, geophysical data from West Antarctica as a whole, and the Weddell Sea-Ross Sea embayment in particular. Meantime, it seems inadvisable to use the present continental outline of Antarctica on the Pacific side of the Transantarctic Mountains in reconstructing Gondwanaland.},

  abstract     = {The producing hydrocarbon reservoirs in the Danish North Sea are mainly in the Maastrichtian to Danian Chalk Group and consist of a rather unique and homogeneous type of sediments completely dominated of very fine-grained calcite with $\mu$m size pores and pore throats. This makes the chalk different from most other reservoir rocks. Production from Chalk is nearly unique to the North Sea Basin and the vast majority of the oil and gas in the Danish North Sea is produced from Chalk. Maastrichtian chalk is well exposed in eastern Denmark and several analog studies have been carried out based on studies of coastal cliff sections, exposures in quarries and more recently slim hole cores.

The Chalk project expands the onshore studies to include the Danian and Maastrichtian succession in western Denmark by drilling a 350 m deep core trough the middle Danian -- upper Maastrichtian chalk near Dalbyover in eastern Jylland. It follows the tradition from previous project by combing sedimentological and geophysical investigations so we will also collect reflection -- and refraction seismic data, well logs and georadar data around the well locality.

Here we present a detailed stable-isotope record for the full length of the Greenland Ice-core Project Summit ice core, extending over the past 250 kyr according to a calculated timescale. We find that climate instability was not confined to the last glaciation, but appears also to have been marked during the last interglacial (as explored more fully in a companion paper3) and during the previous Saale-Holstein glacial cycle. This is in contrast with the extreme stability of the Holocene, suggesting that recent climate stability may be the exception rather than the rule. The last interglacial seems to have lasted longer than is implied by the deep-sea SPECMAP record4, in agreement with other land-based observations5,6. We suggest that climate instability in the early part of the last interglacial may have delayed the melting of the Saalean ice sheets in America and Eurasia, perhaps accounting for this discrepancy.},

CS builds upon the fundamental fact that we can represent many signals using only a few non-zero coecients in a suitable basis or dictionary. Nonlinear optimization can then enable recovery of such signals from very few measurements. In this chapter, we provide an up-to-date review of the basic theory underlying CS. After a brief historical overview, we begin with a discussion of sparsity and other low dimensional signal models. We then treat the central question of how to accurately recover a high-dimensional signal from a small set of measurements and provide performance guarantees for a variety of sparse recovery algorithms. We conclude with a discussion of some extensions of the sparse recovery framework. In subsequent chapters of the book, we will see how the fundamentals presented in this chapter are extended in many exciting directions, including new models for describing structure in both analog and discrete-time signals, new sensing design techniques, more advanced recovery results, and emerging applications.},

  abstract     = {Two large low-shear-velocity provinces (LLSVPs) in the deep mantle beneath Africa and the Pacific are generally interpreted as hot but chemically dense 'piles', which have remained isolated from mantle circulation for several hundred million years. This interpretation largely hinges on four seismic observations: (i) their shear wave velocity anomalies are considered too large for purely thermal structures; (ii) shear wave velocity gradients at their edges are sharp; (iii) their shear to compressional wave-speed anomaly ratios are high; and (iv) their shear and bulk-sound velocity anomalies appear to be anti-correlated. However, using compressible global mantle circulation models driven by 300. Myr of plate motion history and thermodynamic methods for converting from physical to seismic structure, we show that observed lower mantle shear wave velocity anomalies do not require, and are most likely incompatible with, large-scale chemical 'piles'. A prescribed core-mantle-boundary temperature of 4000. K, which is consistent with current estimates, combined with anelastic seismic sensitivity to temperature, ensures that purely thermal LLSVPs, strongly focussed beneath Africa and the Pacific by subduction history, can reconcile observed shear wave velocity anomalies and gradients. By contrast, shear wave velocity anomalies from models that include dense chemical 'piles' at the base of Earth's mantle, where 'piles' correspond to only 3{\%} of the mantle's volume, are substantially stronger than the tomographic model S40RTS, even after accounting for limited tomographic resolution. Our results also suggest that in the presence of post-perovskite, elevated ratios between shear and compressional wave-speed anomalies and the correlation between shear and bulk-sound velocity anomalies cannot be used to discriminate between thermal and compositional heterogeneity at depth: in all calculations, an anti-correlation only occurs within the post-perovskite stability field. Taken together, this implies that although there must be considerable chemical heterogeneity within Earth's mantle, large, coherent 'piles' are not required to reconcile the seismic observations examined here. Indeed, our results suggest that if chemical heterogeneity is present in these regions, its dynamical and seismic significance is far less than has previously been inferred. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The map consists of three components. First, in regions of young ocean crust ({\textless}67.7 Ma) the model estimate uses a half-space conduction model based on the age of the oceanic crust, since it is well known that raw data measurements are frequently influenced by significant hydrothermal circulation. Second, in other regions of data coverage the estimate is based on data measurements. At the map resolution, these two categories (young ocean, data covered) cover 65{\%} of Earth's surface. Third, for all other regions the estimate is based on the assumption that there is a correlation between heat flow and geology. This assumption is assessed and the correlation is found to provide a minor improvement over assuming that heat flow would be represented by the global average. The map is made available digitally.

  abstract     = {We present a revised estimate of Earth's surface heat flux that is based upon a heat flow data-set with 38 347 measurements, which is 55{\%} more than used in previous estimates. Our methodology, like others, accounts for hydrothermal circulation in young oceanic crust by utilising a half-space cooling approximation. For the rest of Earth's surface, we estimate the average heat flow for different geologic domains as defined by global digital geology maps; and then produce the global estimate by multiplying it by the total global area of that geologic domain. The averaging is done on a polygon set which results from an intersection of a 1 degree equal area grid with the original geology polygons; this minimises the adverse influence of clustering. These operations and estimates are derived accurately using methodologies from Geographical Information Science. We consider the virtually un-sampled Antarctica separately and also make a small correction for hot-spots in young oceanic lithosphere. A range of analyses is presented. These, combined with statistical estimates of the error, provide a measure of robustness. Our final preferred estimate is 47$\pm$2 TW, which is greater than previous estimates.},

  abstract  = {The V. F. Xira fault (VFXF) is considered to be the most probable source of several destructive earthquakes that caused significant damage and loss of lives in Lisbon, Portugal and surrounding cities. The fault outcrops in Miocene sediments but is not seen to affect Quaternary terrains. The combination of low slip-rates in the area with erosion/sedimentation rates prevents the identification of active faults in the region. Our goal is to confirm if this fault has been active and to improve seismic hazard assessment in the LTV area. Previous P-wave seismic reflection data indicated the possibility of two shallow fault segments affecting the Holocene alluvium close to the VFXF outcrop. Due to the lack of resolution of this data to detect a small throw ({\textless} 2m) fault, the site was revisited with a high-resolution shallow S-wave reflection profile to confirm the fault segments but results were not completely conclusive. Here, we present reprocessed S-wave data and results of full-elastic seismic modelling to confirm the presence of the suspected faults. Clear indications of faulting were found: change of the shape and the amplitude of the reflection hyperbolae, discontinuities in the reflectors in the stacked section, shear-wave velocity dropping in anticipated the damage zones, and weak fault plane reflections. The results are analyzed further through seismic modeling. We conclude that the shallow fault segments affect the entire thickness of the Holocene alluvium and that the VFXF is active.},

Results from a numerical ice sheet model, an atmospheric general circulation model and an ocean general circulation model are collated and used to provide iceberg production rate, wind field and surface current forcings to an iceberg trajectory model. The iceberg model then determines how icebergs issuing from the Eurasian Ice Sheet travel across the ocean and eventually melt. In addition the release of iceberg sediments is also predicted. The results show that iceberg trajectories are complex and that common features of iceberg movement are clustering in zones of convergence and exit into the North Atlantic through the Iceland-Faeroes Channel. Eurasian icebergs do not penetrate into the interior of the Arctic Ocean. The gathering of icebergs produces a complex meltwater pattern that does not follow the conceptual idea of decreasing meltwater production with distance from the ice sheet margin. Sedimentation results are compared with the meltwater configuration and are found to be a poor indicator of past zones of iceberg melt, with zones of sedimentation extending significantly less far. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {We present seismic results that support the presence of a small, low shear velocity anomaly deeply rooted in the upper mantle transition zone beneath southern Arabia and the Red Sea. The low shear velocity anomaly persists down to the 660 km discontinuity. It is found from the waveform inversion of 2741 Rayleigh wave seismograms taking into account several higher modes. We use records from the permanent IRIS and GEOSCOPE stations completed with data collected after various field deployments of portable stations in the Horn of Africa (INSU experiment), Tanzania. Saudi Arabia and Tibet (PASSCAL experiments). The complete dataset provides a dense ray coverage of the Afro/Arabian continent and allows shear-wave heterogeneities to be resolved with wavelengths of a few hundred kilometers. To achieve a good vertical resolution in the whole upper mantle, we analyze up to the fourth Rayleigh mode in the period range 50-80 s, in addition to the fundamental Rayleigh mode in the period range 50-160 s. We discuss whether the pattern of upper mantle shear velocity anomaly could be related to local causes or to one or several plume conduits in the region. Our lateral resolution may intuitively not be sufficient to resolve a narrow plume conduit at transition zone depths. However, we show that when a dense coverage is available, a narrow low-velocity anomaly will affect the path average measurements for a large number of individual seismograms crossing the anomaly. In this case, the low-velocity perturbation is mapped in the tomographic model, even though smoothed by the lateral resolution. We conclude that our observation is difficult to attribute to a shallow origin or to reconcile with a single narrow plume conduit in the region. It can be explained either by several close narrow plume tails or by a broad region of upwelling. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

We use an extension of the automated waveform inversion approach of Debayle (1999) which improves our mapping of the transition zone with extraction of fundamental and higher-mode information. The new approach is fully automated and has been successfully used to match approximately 375,000 Rayleigh waveforms. For each seismogram, we obtain a path average shear velocity and quality factor model, and a set of fundamental and higher-mode dispersion and attenuation curves. We incorporate the resulting set of path average shear velocity models into a tomographic inversion. In the uppermost 200 km of the mantle, SV wave heterogeneities correlate with surface tectonics. The high velocity signature of cratons is slightly shallower ({\&}{\#}8776;200 km) than in other seismic models. Thicker continental roots are not required by our data, but can be produced by imposing a priori a smoother model in the vertical direction. Regions deeper than 200 km show no velocity contrasts larger than $\pm$1{\%} at large scale, except for high velocity slabs within the transition zone. Comparisons with other seismic models show that current surface wave datasets allow to build consistent models up to degrees 40 in the upper 200 km of the mantle. The agreement is poorer in the transition zone and confined to low harmonic degrees ({\&}{\#}8804;10).},

  abstract     = {Advance of the Late Weichselian (Valdaian) Scandinavian Ice Sheet (SIS) in northwestern Russia took place after a period of periglacial conditions. Till of the last SIS, Bobrovo till, overlies glacial deposits from the previous Barents and Kara Sea ice sheets and marine deposits of the Last Interglacial. The till is identified by its contents of Scandinavian erratics and it has directional properties of westerly provenance. Above the deglaciation sediments, and extra marginally, it is replaced by glaciofluvial and glaciolacustrine deposits. At its maximum extent, the last SIS was more restricted in Russia than previously outlined and the time of termination at 18 - 16 cal. kyr BP was almost 10 kyr delayed compared to the southwestern part of the ice sheet. We argue that the lithology of the ice sheets' substrate, and especially the location of former proglacial lake basins, influenced the dynamics of the ice sheet and guided the direction of flow. We advocate that, while reaching the maximum extent, lobe-shaped glaciers protruded eastward from SIS and moved along the path of water-filled lowland basins. Ice-sheet collapse and deglaciation in the region commenced when ice lobes were detached from the main ice sheet. During the Lateglacial warming, disintegration and melting took place in a 200 - 600 km wide zone along the northeastern rim of SIS associated with thick Quaternary accumulations. Deglaciation occurred through aerial downwasting within large fields of dead ice developed during successively detached ice lobes. Deglaciation led to the development of hummocky moraine landscapes with scattered periglacial and ice-dammed lakes, while a subarctic flora invaded the region.},

  abstract  = {The marginal configurations and ages of the Valdaian (Weichselian) glacial maxima in northern Russia have hitherto not been well established, thus, numerous versions of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) positions of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet are known (Fig.1B). New data on ice sheet growth and decay indicate at least three glacial maxima during the Late Pleistocene each with individual spreading centres and different ages. Results of modern investigations in the Arkhangelsk region, conducted by the authors, are compared with an analysis of previous data on the Late Quaternary geology of Northwest Russia, which comprises a thorough presentation of Russian literature on this subject. This has allowed us to question and revise former models on Valdaian glaciation history and icemarginal positions in a major part of the Russian North. An Early-Middle Valdaian (c. 70 ka BP) glaciation from the east and southeast, possibly originating on the Timan ridge, crossed the Pyoza River basin and reached the White Sea coast along the Bay of Mezen. The southern terminus of the ice sheet is probably found along parts of the Mezen River (Fig. 2 A,B). The presence of an Early-Middle Valdaian Scandinavian glaciation, which covered the Arkhangelsk region and in neighbouring areas of Karelia and Vologda is not supported by geological data. In the Middle Valdaian (c. 60 ka BP) an ice sheet from the Barents-Kara Sea flowed from the north, northeast and reached the lower Pyoza River and the south and western shores of Mezen Bay on the White Sea coast. The terminal formations of its maximal stage stretch from west to east just north of Pyoza River and then run marginal to the Timan ridge from the north joining with the Markhida endmoraines on the Pechora Lowland (Fig. 2 A,B). During the Late Valdaian, the Scandinavian Ice Sheet occupied the northwestern part of the Arkhangelsk region around 19-17 ka BP. The limit of this Late Valdaian glacial maximum runs from the White Sea shore of the Kanin Peninsula in the north, along the Kuloi River south of Mezen to the Middle Pinega River, crossing the rivers Severnaya Dvina and Vaga near the villages of Cherevkovo and Ust-Padenga. The glacial boundary bordered the Melovian and Nyandoma high ground and continued southwestwards to Lake Kubenskoe in the Vologda region. The Pyoza, Mezen and Vashka river basins remained icefree during the Late Valdaian time, this area being covered by fluvial flood plains, with abundant evidence of permafrost and lakes. The latter have yielded pollen evidence indicating an arctic to subarctic environment between 18-20 ka BP (Fig. 2 A,B). ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {A case is made that seasonality switches dominated by wintertime were instrumental in abrupt climate changes in the North Atlantic region during the last glaciation and into the Holocene. The primary evidence comes from mismatches between mean annual temperatures from Greenland ice cores in comparison with snowline changes in East Greenland, northern Europe, and North America. The most likely explanation is a shutdown (or reduction in strength) of the conveyor. This allows the spread of winter sea ice across the North Atlantic, thus causing the northern region to experience much colder winters. Because they mimic the Greenland temperature rather than the snowline signal, changes in the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone and the Asian monsoon may also share a winter linkage with Greenland. Thus the paleoclimate record is consistent with the notion that a huge continental sector of the Northern Hemisphere, stretching from Greenland to Asia, was close to an extreme winter threshold during much of the last glaciation. Winter climate crossed this threshold repeatedly, with marked changes in seasonality that may well have amplified and propagated a signal of abrupt change throughout the hemisphere and into the tropics. ?? 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Additional seismic observations indicate that these structures cannot result from purely thermal effects. Compositional anomalies are required to fully explain seismic observations, but their exact nature is still debated. Here, we show that low shear-wave velocity provinces unlikely consist of recycled oceanic crust (MORB). We calculated seismic sensitivity to high-pressure MORB, and found that in the lowermost mantle shear-wave velocity increases with increasing fraction of MORB. Therefore, unless they are heated up to unrealistic temperatures, high-pressure MORB would induce high shear-wave velocity, in contradiction with the observations. Instead, material enriched in iron by {\~{}}3.0{\%} and in (Mg,Fe)-perovskite by {\~{}}20{\%} compared to regular mantle provides a good explanation for the low shear-wave velocity provinces and for the high bulk-sound velocities observed in the same areas. In addition, several geochemical and geodynamical arguments support a primitive origin for this material. Low shear-wave velocity provinces may thus consist of reservoirs of primitive material that have differentiated early in the Earth's history. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {In seismic exploration, statistical wavelet estimation and deconvolution are standard tools. Both of these processes assume randomness in the seismic reflectivity sequence and also make a minimum phase assumption about the actual wavelet embedded in the trace. The validity of these assumptions is examined by using well--log reflectivity sequences, synthetic seismic traces, and by using a procedure for evaluating the resulting deconvolutions. With real data, wavelet estimations are compared with the in--situ recording of the actual waveform from a vertical seis- mic profile (VSP). As a result of these investigations, this thesis presents a fairly simple group of tests that can be used to evaluate the validity of the randomness and minimum phase assumptions. From the investigations of seismic data in Alberta, it is concluded that the assumption of reflec- tivity randomness is less of a problem in deconvolution than other assumptions such as phase and stationarity.},

In this way local intricacies resulting from truncating and interfering foliations and folds can be simplified by ordering structures with respect to their kinematic connotation. The resulting deformation scheme is simple and facilitates regional correlations, and simultaneously places metamorphic textures in a kinematic-structural background. The mobile belt in Prydz Bay is exposed along 200 km of coastline, and consists of granulite-facies gneiss in which low- to mid-crustal, compressional D1-2 structures, and mid- to upper-crustal, extensional D3-6 structures and relateddecompression-cooling textures are best explained in an exhumation model involving extensional collapse of upper crust in an overall compressional tectonic setting. This implies that compression and extension structures are genetically related. However, D3-6 structures in the Larsemann Hills appear to have formed between 550 and 500 Ma, whilst D2 structures in the Rauer Group have been dated at 1100-1000 Ma. Reinterpretation of the latter dates is possible, implying that most high-grade deformation in Prydz Bay is early Palaeozoic. ?? 1995.},

A simple but accurate formula is developed for the quick calculation of interval velocities from "average velocities" determined by the known x 2 -T 2 technique. To secure accuracy a careful study of multiple reflections is necessary, and this is discussed. Although the principal objective in determining velocities is to allow an accurate structural interpretation to be made from seismic reflection data, an important secondary objective is to get some lithological information. This is obtained through a correlation of velocities with rock type and depth.},

These phenomena are discussed with special reference to the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Late Cenozoic uplift and erosion have affected large expanses of the shelf, and in particular the Barents Sea. Up to 3000 m of sedimentary overburden have been removed from the Barents shelf, and this process is widely held to be responsible for disappointing results in petroleum exploration. Negative effects identified include spillage of hydrocarbons from accumulations, expansion of gas and evacuation of structures, potential for seal failure and cooling of source rocks. We argue, however, that these aspects have been overstated based on a limited database.Many of the world's hydrocarbon basins (and most of the world's petroleum reserves) lie on land. Most of these basins must have been recently uplifted in order to be above sea level today. Using some of these examples, we show that in other areas with a similar magnitude of uplift and erosion to the Barents Sea sealing capacity (particularly that of evaporites) has been preserved. Hydrocarbon systems have remained intact despite phase changes and redistribution of hydrocarbons. Several enhancing effects of the uplift are documented, including the development of fracture permeability in reservoirs, the remigration of hydrocarbons to shallower subsurface levels and the exsolution of light oil (retrograde condensate). Looking to a future in which natural gas may have increased value, potential exists in uplifted basins such as the Barents Sea for vast volumes of methane formed by exsolution from formation brines.We stress the importance of studying such worldwide analogues in order to throw new light on Norwegian shelf problems. Attention is drawn to some striking similarities between the hydrocarbon systems of the Western Canada Basin and those of the Barents Sea. Examination of the massive databases in the Western Canada Basin and other analogous provinces, rather than a continuing locally-centred approach, will probably help to focus exploration directions in the Barents Sea and may help to distinguish between the effects of uplift and erosion per se and those of more specific, local phenomena such as ice loading and rapid deglaciation.},

  abstract     = {10.1 Introduction Seismology entirely depends on international co-operation. Only the accumulation of large sets of compatible high quality data in standardized formats from many stations and networks around the globe and over long periods of time will yield sufficiently reliable long-term results in event localization, seismicity rate and hazard assessment, investigations into the structure and rheology of the Earth's interior and other priority tasks in seismological research and applications. For almost a century, only parameter readings taken from seismograms were exchanged with other stations and regularly transferred to national or international data centers for further processing. Because of the uniqueness of traditional paper seismograms and lacking opportunities for producing high-quality copies at low cost, original analog waveform data, cumbersome to handle and prone to damage or even loss, were rarely exchanged. The procedures for carefully processing, handling, annotating and storing such records have been extensively described in the 1979 edition of the Manual of Seismological Observatory Practice (Willmore, 1979) in the chapter Station operation. They are not repeated here. Also the traditional way of reporting parameter readings from seismograms to international data centers such as the U.S. Geological Survey National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC), the International Seismological Centre (ISC) or the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) are outlined in the old Manual in detail in the section Reporting output. They have not changed essentially since then. On the other hand, respective working groups on parameter formats of the IASPEI and of its regional European Seismological Commission (ESC) have meanwhile debated for many years how to make these formats more homogeneous, consistent and flexible so as to better accommodate also other seismologically relevant parameter information. Any data report, of course, must follow a format known to the recipient in order to be successfully parsed. Some of the goals for any format are: $\bullet$ concise avoiding unnecessary expense in transmission and storage; $\bullet$ complete providing all of the information required to use the data; $\bullet$ transparent easily read by a person, perhaps without documentation; and $\bullet$ simple straightforward to write and parse with computer programs.},

Ice cap motion is generally less than about 10 m a(-1), except where faster flowing curvilinear features with velocities of several tens to over 200 m a(-1) are present. Most drainage basins of Austfonna have undergone ice-marginal retreat over the past few decades at an average of a few tens of meters per year. Integrating margin change around the whole ice cap gives a total area loss of about 10 km(2) a(-1). Iceberg flux from the marine margins of Austfonna is about 2.5 +/- 0.5 km(3) a(-1) (water equivalent), about 45{\%} of the total calving flux from the whole Svalbard archipelago. When mass loss by iceberg production is taken into account, the total mass balance of Austfonna is negative by between about 2.5 and 4.5 km(3) a(-1). This iceberg flux represents about 33 +/- 5{\%} of total annual mass loss from Austfonna, with the remainder lost through surface ablation. Iceberg flux should be included in calculations of the total mass balance of the many large Arctic ice caps, including those located in the Russian and Canadian Arctic that end in tidewater. The neglect of this term has led to underestimates of mass loss from these ice caps and, thus, to underestimates of the contribution of Arctic ice caps to global sea level rise.},

High-resolution imagery of seafloor morphology is available for many polar shelves and fjords. The rapidity of ice retreat is inferred from diagnostic assemblages of submarine landforms, produced at ice-stream sedimentary beds. These landforms, exposed by ice retreat across high-latitude shelves, demonstrate that deglaciation occurs in three main ways: rapidly, by flotation and breakup; episodically, by still-stands and/or grounding events punctuating rapid retreat; or by slower retreat of grounded ice. Submarine landform assemblages imply, through the presence of grounding-zone wedges overprinting mega-scale glacial lineations on many polar shelves, that ice-stream retreat is more often episodic than catastrophic. These observations provide a robust test of the ability of numerical models to predict the varied response of ice-sheet basins to environmental changes.},

The direction of ice flow is inferred front the pattern of buildup of thousands of cubic kilometers of glacier-derived debris and observations of large-scale streamlined landforms on former subglacial beds. We demonstrate that ice streams can undergo major changes in flow direction through modification of their large-scale topographic setting. Whereas ice-stream switching in modern ice sheets has been regarded mainly as a reflection of internal changes in ice-sheet dynamics, switching over successive 100 k.y. glacial cycles may in this case be a response to the effects of continuing sediment deposition and the large-scale development of ice-influenced continental margins.},

However, it is difficult to demonstrate the presence of ice sheets in the ancient record because their sedimentary products can resemble those from nonglacial processes (e.g., debris flows). Diagnostic large-scale glacial landforms, produced beneath ice sheets and preserved on continental shelves after deglaciation, can establish a glacial origin. Three-dimensional seismic evidence from the 2.7 Ma Naust Formation, Norwegian margin, illustrates several glacial landforms that are also commonly occurring features on modern high-latitude shelves: (1) streamlined mega-scale lineations produced by fast-flowing ice streams; (2) ploughmarks formed by iceberg keels; and (3), regularly spaced transverse ridges or push moraines formed during ice retreat. We have found, for example, buried ice-keel ploughmarks on a palleoshelf dating to ca. 2 Ma. Norwegian margin seismic stratigraphy data show that ice advanced and retreated many times, and some paleoshelf surfaces were preserved. Such paleosurfaces must survive ocean basin destruction for glacial landforms to be useful in identification of ancient depositional environments.},

During late Weichselian time, similar to 4000 km(3) of sediments were deposited over the Bear Island fan (280 000 km(2)) while similar to 700 km(3) of sediments were deposited over the Storfjorden fan (40 000 km(2)). A numerical ice-sheet model, including sediment deformation and transport beneath ice streams, reconstructs the glacial conditions required to transport large volumes of sediment to the late Weichselian Eurasian continental margin. Model results indicate that glaciation of the Eurasian High Arctic occurred after 28 ka, and that ice streams within bathymetric troughs were active by ca. 25 ka, The maximum ice-sheet thickness over the Barents Sea was about 1400 m; there was a secondary dome {\textless}1200 m thick over the Kara Sea. Ice extended to the shelf break along the western Barents Sea and Arctic Ocean margins. Ice-sheet decay affected the marine portions of the ice sheet after 15 ka, leaving a northern ice mass between Svalbard and Franz Josef Land that decayed after 13 ka. Ice streams draining ice west and north from the Barents-Kara Sea existed in major bathymetric troughs. Model results predict that ice streams transported sediments to the margin from 27 to 13 ka. Sediment delivery to the margins was generally very high during that time. At 15 ka, the sedimentation rate over the 200-km-wide mouth of the Bear Island trough was similar to 4 cm yr(-1) (0.13 cm yr(-1) averaged over the fan); the rate was 6 cm yr(-1) (equivalent to 0.6 cm yr(-1) over the fan) over the Storfjorden trough mouth. The modeled sediment volume at the continental margin of the Bear Island and Storfjorden troughs agrees well with the volumes of late Weichselian sediment inferred from seismic records om these large prograding submarine fans, Sensitivity experiments show that adjustments to model environmental inputs do not significantly affect the results.},

  abstract     = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein$-$protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD $\leq$ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The disadvantages of Fourier analysis, such as frequency spillover or problems due to sampling (data window) truncation can often be minimized by various windowing techniques, but they nevertheless exist. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to track and visualize amplitude and time-varying power systems harmonics, without frequency spillover caused by time-frequency techniques. This new tool allows for a clear visualization of time-varying harmonics, which can lead to better ways to track harmonic distortion and understand time-dependent power quality parameters. It also has the potential to assist with control, protection and power quality applications. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract     = {The raised beaches and deltas of Devon Island contain an abundance of dateable materials. A large set of radiocarbon dates (228), 154 of which are new, are used to construct relative sea level curves and isobase maps for the island. The best materials for this purpose are driftwood logs (61 dates) and bowhead whale bones (74 dates) from raised beaches and mollusc shells from marine-limit deltas (20 dates) or from altitudes close to marine limit (14 dates). During the last glacial maximum, the island is thought to have lain beneath the southeastern flank of the Innuitian Ice Sheet. The relative sea level history is congruent with that inferred ice configuration. The island spans half the ice sheet width. Relative sea level curves are of simple exponential form, except near the glacial limit where an early Holocene emergence proceeded to a middle Holocene lowstand below present sea level, which was followed by submergence attending the passage of the crustal forebulge. The response times of relative sea level curves and of crustal uplift decrease from the uplift centre toward the limit of loading, but the change appears strongest near the limit. The Innuitian uplift is separated from the Laurentide uplift to the south by a strong isobase embayment over Lancaster Sound. Hence, ice load irregularities with wavelengths of about 100 km were large enough to leave an isostatic thumbprint in this region of the continent. The apparent absence of a similar embayment over Jones Sound probably indicates a greater Late Wisconsinan ice load there, or a thicker crust than in Lancaster Sound.},

No consensus has yet emerged and the spectrum of interpretations within the last decade is the broadest ever. The glacial geology of Devon Island strongly supports the Late Wisconsinan Innuitian Ice Sheet hypothesis. During LGM, the southeastern part of the Queen Elizabeth Islands was covered by an ice sheet flowing from a centre, or a divide centrally located, in the archipelago. Another ice divide extended from the centre across Devon Island. Flow from the Innuitian centre and convergent flow from Devon Island, and probably also from Cornwallis and Bathurst Islands, sustained an ice stream in Wellington Channel. Ice was locally advancing to its LGM limit about 23 ka BP. Recession in the vicinity of the present coastline was underway by 10 ka BP and final ice remnants west of the present Devon Ice Cap vanished about 8 ka BP. The island bears the same two-part landscape zonation as do other islands and peninsulas in the region. These reflect a cold-based core and warm-based periphery at LGM.},

  abstract     = {The Late Wisconsinan advance of the Laurentide Ice Sheet started from a Middle Wisconsinan interstadial minimum 27-30 14C ka BP when the ice margin approximately followed the boundary of the Canadian Shield. Ice extent in the Cordillera and in the High Arctic at that time was probably similar to present. Ice advanced to its Late Wisconsinan (stage 2) limit in the northwest, south, and northeast about 23-24 14C ka BP and in the southwest and far north about 20-21 14C ka BP. In comparison to some previous reconstructions of ice extent, our current reconstruction has substantially more Late Wisconsinan ice in the High Arctic, where an Innuitian Ice Sheet is generally acknowledged to have existed, in the Atlantic Provinces, where ice is now thought to have extended to the Continental Shelf edge in most places, and on eastern Baffin Island, where ice probably extended to the fiord mouths rather than to the fiord heads. Around most of the ice margin, the Late Wisconsinan maximum ice extent either exceeded the extent of earlier Wisconsinan advances or it was similar to the Early Wisconsinan advance. Ice marginal recession prior to 14 14C ka BP occurred mainly in deep water and along the southern terrestrial fringe. However, Heinrich event 1 probably drew down the entire central ice surface at 14.5 14C ka BP sufficiently to displace the Labrador Sector outflow centre 900 km eastward from the coast of Hudson Bay. The onset of substantial ice marginal recession occurred about 14 14C ka BP in the northwest, southwest, and south but not until about 10-11 14C ka BP in the northeast and in the High Arctic. Thus, the period of maximum ice extent in North America generally encompasses the interval from $\sim$24/21 to 14 14C ka BP, or considerably longer than the duration of the LGM defined as occurring during a period of low global sea level as well as during a time of relative climate stability $\sim$18 14C ka BP. The interval of advance of much of the Laurentide Ice Sheet to its maximum extent (between $\sim$27 14C ka BP and $\sim$24 14C ka BP) coincides with a suggested interval of rapid fall in global sea level to near LGM levels. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Regional continental stress fi elds agree well with stress orientations predicted by the main forces driv- ing and resisting plate motion. However, regional continental stress fi elds fail to explain major localized compressive plate deformation in continental interiors far away from plate bound- aries. Global or plate-wide intraplate stress models typically assume a laterally homogeneous plate rheology and are confi ned to modeling the present, without addressing the antiquity of the current stress fi eld. An understanding of intraplate stress and deformation requires the linking of spatial variations in continental rheology with time-dependent plate geometry and driving forces. Here we demonstrate how the complex interplay between juxtaposed weak and strong geological provinces and changes in far-fi eld plate boundary forces has caused intra- plate orogenesis and tectonic reactivation in southeastern Australia during the Tertiary. Our fi ndings are contrary to the opinion that continental interiors are insensitive to compression at plate margins, and help to explain the mechanisms causing intraplate orogenesis.},

The data set was supplemented with a special study of 12 years of ISC phase data which yielded an additional 1.75 ?? 106 travel time observations for P and S waves. In order to obtain satisfactory agreement with the entire data set we were required to take into account anelastic dispersion. The introduction of transverse isotropy into the outer 220 km of the mantle was required in order to satisfy the shorter period fundamental toroidal and spheroidal modes. This anisotropy also improved the fit of the larger data set. The horizontal and vertical velocities in the upper mantle differ by 2-4{\%}, both for P and S waves. The mantle below 220 km is not required to be anisotropic. Mantle Rayleigh waves are surprisingly sensitive to compressional velocity in the upper mantle. High Sn velocities, low Pn velocities and a pronounced low-velocity zone are features of most global inversion models that are suppressed when anisotropy is allowed for in the inversion.

  abstract     = {The first law of economists states that for every economist there exists an equal and opposite economist. In that spirit, Nature this week presents related articles that take contradictory stances on what the banking system could, or indeed should, learn from ecologists. In a Perspective (see page 351), Andrew Haldane, executive director of financial stability at the Bank of England in London, and Robert May, a theoretical ecologist at the University of Oxford, UK, and former chief scientific adviser to the UK government, argue that the stability of complex networks of linked dependencies that make up the world's financial system can be tested using a simplified ecological model. They say that the results of their approach highlight ways in which economic policy could be changed to make the system more secure. Regulation of elements such as liquidity ratios, banking structures and trade in complex derivatives, they say, should work to protect the system rather than individual banks.},

Results from two outer shelf cores covering the last 13.6 k 14C yr BP are presented in this paper. The sediments accumulated in north--south trending basins on each side of the Kolbeinsey Ridge at water depths of ca. 400 m. Sedimentation rates up to 1.5 m kyr$-$1 are observed during the Late-glacial and Holocene. The Vedde and Saksunarvatn tephras are present in the cores as well as the Hekla 1104. A new tephra, KOL-GS-2, has been identified and dated to 13.4 k 14C yr BP, and another tephra, geochemically identical to the Borrobol Tephra, has been found at the same level. At present, the oceanographic Polar Front is located on the North Icelandic shelf, which experiences sharp oceanographic surface boundaries between the cold East Icelandic Current and the warmer Irminger Current. Past changes in sedimentological and biological processes in the study area are assumed to be related to fluctuations of the Polar Front. The area was deglaciated before ca. 14 kyr BP, but there is evidence of ice rafting up to the end of the GS-1 (Greenland Stadial 1, Younger Dryas) period, increasing again towards the end of the Holocene. Foraminiferal studies show a relatively strong GS-2 (pre-13 kyr BP) palaeo-Irminger Current, followed by severe cooling and then by unstable conditions during the remainder of the GI-1 (Greenland Interstadial 1, B{\o}lling--Aller{\o}d) and GS-1 (Younger Dryas). Another cooling event occurred during the Preboreal before the Holocene current system was established at about 9 kyr BP. After a climatic optimum between 9 and 6 kyr BP the climate began to deteriorate and fluctuate. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2000 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

An array of geological records supported by climate modelling indicates a profound shift in global climate during this interval, from a state that was largely free of polar ice caps to one in which ice sheets on Antarctica approached their modern size. However, the early glaciation history of the Northern Hemisphere is a subject of controversy. Here we report stratigraphically extensive ice-rafted debris, including macroscopic dropstones, in late Eocene to early Oligocene sediments from the Norwegian-Greenland Sea that were deposited between about 38 and 30 million years ago. Our data indicate sediment rafting by glacial ice, rather than sea ice, and point to East Greenland as the likely source. Records of this type from one site alone cannot be used to determine the extent of ice involved. However, our data suggest the existence of (at least) isolated glaciers on Greenland about 20 million years earlier than previously documented, at a time when temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were substantially higher.},

Late Wisconsin palaeobotanical and fossil insect data from the central and northern sectors of the Bering land bridge indicate widespread mesic shrub tundra environments even during the last glacial maximum, Contrary to previous hypotheses, we found no evidence of steppe tundra on the land bridge, New accelerator mass spectrometer C-14 dates show much of the land bridge was above sea level and thus available for human and animal migration until 11,000 yr BP. Insect evidence suggests that summer temperatures at that time were substantially warmer than now.},

In the Ross Sea sector of the Transantarctic Mountains, Jurassic igneous rocks, comprising pyroclastic rocks and Ferrar Group tholeiitic basalts, overlie fluvial strata of the Permian-Upper Triassic Gondwana sequence. Petrological, structural and volcanological data suggest that the Jurassic pyroclastic rocks and overlying flood basalts were erupted into a volcano-tectonic rift system associated with lithospheric extension and decompression melting. Geochemically the Ferrar tholeiites form part of the Gondwana low-Ti province, but they exhibit marked differences in initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios and in high field strength element abundances in comparison with other parts of the province.Three Early to Middle Jurassic tectono-magmatic terrains were present in this part of Gondwanaland: a plate margin magmatic arc; a belt of silicic within-plate igneous rocks inboard of the arc; and a continental flood basalt province (the Gondwana low-Ti province). Silicic volcanism mainly preceeded emplacement of Ferrar tholeiites, whereas major silicic activity elsewhere either accompanied basaltic magmatism or, though spatially separated preceded it. Younger magmatic episodes have obscured much of the plate margin record. Lack of reliable age determinations makes details of relations between tectonism and magmatism difficult to assess.},

  year      = {1998},
  abstract  = {The five-year PONAM (Polar North Atlantic Margin: Late Cenozoic Evolution) programme was launched by the European Science Foundation in 1989. Its aim was to study the major climate-driven environmental variations in the Norwegian-Greenland (also Nordic) Sea and its continental margins over the last 5 million years. The programme has provided substantial new insights into the contrasting behaviour of the ice sheets covering the Svalbard-Barents Sea and East Greenland over the last glacial-interglacial cycle in particular. The highly dynamic Svalbard Barents Sea Ice Sheet, after reaching the shelf edge during each stadial, almost vanished during subsequent interstadials. By contrast, the East Greenland Ice Sheet showed only minor advances confined to fjord basins or ending on the inner shelf. Although there is a striking correspondence in the timing and duration of the first post-Eemian ice advance in East Greenland and on Svalbard, their chronology and dynamics have been very different since about 65 ka. The Svalbard-Barents Sea Ice Sheet showed well-defined Middle and Late Weichselian ice advances, whereas the East Greenland Ice Sheet was characterised by a 55 kyr-long period with a relatively stable ice margin located in fjords or the inner shelf. The contrasting behaviour of the two ice sheets is probably linked to the palaeoceanographic circulation pattern in the Polar North Atlantic. East Greenland is under the influence of the cold East Greenland Current, whereas the development and behaviour of ice in the Barents Sea is influenced by the continuous, but highly variable. North Atlantic meridional current system that has resulted in a northward inflow of relatively warm waters of Atlantic origin on the eastern side of the Polar North Atlantic. Of particular interest are the so-called 'Nordway events' in glacial stages 6 and 4 to 2. These represented periods of pronounced inflow of temperate waters from the south and an associated increase in seasonally open waters, providing moisture for ice-sheet growth. The largest of these events ended in major glaciations, which were reflected in terrestrial glacial sequences and in deep-sea records of ice-rafted debris. Differences in ice extent and dynamics around the Polar North Atlantic are expressed in the evolution and architecture of its east and west continental margins. The Svalbard-Barents Sea Ice Sheet developed much later than the East Greenland Ice Sheet, in the Late Pliocene as compared with the Middle/Late Miocene. The Svalbard-Barents Sea margin is characterised by major prograding fans, built mainly of stacked debris flows. These fans are interpreted as products of rapid sediment delivery from fast-flowing ice streams reaching the shelf break during full glacial conditions. Such major submarine fans are not found north of the Scoresby Sund Fan off East Greenland, where ice seldom reached the shelf break, sedimentation rates were relatively low and sediment transport appears to have been localised in several major deep-sea submarine channel systems. Few debris flows are present and more uniform, acoustically-stratified sediments predominate. In general, the Greenland Ice Sheet has been more stable than those on the European North Atlantic margin, which reflect greater variability in heat and moisture transfer at timescale varying from 100,000 year glacial cycles to millennial-scale fluctuations.},

  abstract  = {The Sverdrup Basin is located in the Canadian Arctic Islands. It is 1,000 km by 350 km and is filled with up to 13 km of Carboniferous to Paleogene strata. The basin initially developed in Early Carboniferous as a rift basin upon highly deformed Early Paleozoic strata of the Ellesmerian Orogenic Belt. The development of the basin can be broken into eight phases, each being characterized by a distinctive combination of tectonic, depositional and climatic regimes and separated by episodes of widespread uplift and basin reorganization. The Upper Paleozoic strata are up to 5 km thick and are characterized by a distinct shelf to deep basin topography. Carbonate strata dominated the shelf until Middle Permian and were supplanted by siliciclastics and chert in Middle and Late Permian when the climate cooled. Triassic siliciclastics are up to 4 km thick and they filled the deep, central basin by Late Triassic. From latest Triassic to earliest Cretaceous the basin was occupied by shallow siliciclastics shelves and up to 2 km of strata accumulated. Renewed rifting in Early Cretaceous resulted in a thick succession (2 km) of Early Cretaceous non-marine to shallow marine strata with units of basalts in the northeast. Widespread diabase sill and dyke intrusion, likely related to the Alpha Ridge Plume and the opening of the Amerasia Ocean Basin, occurred at this time. Following an interval of low subsidence and low sediment supply in the Late Cretaceous, the basin began to be deformed in earliest Paleocene by the Eurekan Orogeny driven by the counterclockwise rotation of Greenland. Local foreland basins developed and contain up to 3 km of Paleocene-Eocene strata. In Late Eocene the basin was uplifted and deformed by faulting and folding with deformation decreasing southwestwards. Eighteen oil and gas fields have been discovered in Eurekan anticlines and potential prospects include traps associated with Eurekan structures, salt domes, reefs and prominent unconformities. Widespread petroleum source rocks are documented in Middle and Upper Triassic strata and likely occur with other stratigraphic intervals from Carboniferous to Lower Cretaceous. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {This paper constitutes a fundamental revision of the author's earlier research and resolves a long-standing debate concerning the late Quaternary history of the Canadian High Arctic, supporting its inundation by glaciers during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). A transect along east Ellesmere Island demonstrates that ice advanced northward and southward along the axis of Nares Strait during the late Wisconsinan, debouching from a central saddle in Kane Basin. The configuration of Ellesmere Island and Greenland ice is based on moraines, meltwater channels and erratics. The youngest AMS 14C date obtained on shelly till suggests ice buildup after 19 ka BP whereas many other dates are younger than 30 ka BP. Furthermore, the lowest (youngest) detectable amino acid ratios on shells from till postdate the Robeson aminozone ({\textgreater} 70 ka BP) and are separated from Holocene ratios by a narrow gap wholly consistent with the occupation of the strait by late Wisconsinan ice. Re-entry of the sea throughout Nares Strait is shown by a series of paleogeographic maps based on geomorphic evidence and radiocarbon dates on shells associated with marine limit. Deglaciation at the north end of the strait occurred by 10.1 ka BP and, at the south end, by 9.0 ka BP. Nares Strait may still have been blocked by ice north of Kane Basin at 8 ka BP, however; by 7.5 ka BP it provided an unobstructed seaway from the Arctic Ocean to Baffin Bay. The prominent ice margins within the fiords of eastern Ellesmere Island, previously considered to mark the last ice limit, record regional stabilization of land-based ice after breakup of preceding marine-based margins. Other implications of this study are: that ice buildup occurred post-30 ka BP (and possibly post-19 ka BP) during an interval widely assumed to be constrained by severe aridity in the high arctic; and that coalescent Greenland and Ellesmere Island ice during the LGM promoted thickening of the eastern Ellesmere Island ice divide, causing enhanced westward flow across the island to Eureka Sound. Sizeable postglacial emergence (80-120 m) on eastern Ellesmere Island is associated with the retreat of thick ice (??? 1 km) from the strait. Greater emergence in Eureka Sound, which extends southward into the central arctic islands, confirms the previously proposed axis of the Innuitian Ice Sheet. Further clarification of the extent, geometry, and retreat of the Innuitian Ice Sheet will provide new opportunities for glaciological and geophysical modelling, and help to identify late Quaternary sediment sources for the Arctic Ocean and Baffin Bay.},

  abstract     = {Portrayal of North American ice cover during the Last Glacial Maximum is dominated by the Laurentide Ice Sheet, leaving little detail for the adjacent Innuitian Ice Sheet (IIS). Four decades of geological fieldwork across the Queen Elizabeth Islands now warrant specific treatment of the IIS, including its chronology, configuration, dynamics and retreat. This reconstruction is relevant to the sedimentary history of the Arctic Ocean and to high latitude climate forcing. The IIS was composed of both an alpine and lowland sector. The advance of the alpine sector occurred as recently as 19 14C ka BP. Geological evidence configures outflow from alpine and lowland divides that produced several palaeo-ice streams, one extending northwestward across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago to the polar continental shelf. Retreat of the IIS commenced along its southwest margin $\sim$11.6 14C ka BP. However, most of the ice sheet remained on the continental shelf during the Younger Dryas. By $\sim$10 14C ka BP, marine-based ice experienced widespread calving through the western and central archipelago in response to Holocene warming and ongoing eustatic sea level rise. The sea penetrated the eastern archipelago by 8.5 14C ka BP, gutting the alpine sector of the IIS. Regional isobases record the glacioisostatic signature of the ice sheet, and are congruent with the primary geological evidence. The delayed buildup of the IIS was out-of-phase with the growth of the Laurentide Ice Sheet that occasioned climatic and glacio-eustatic forcing in the Innuitian region. Recent modelling experiments reinforce the hypothesis that growth of the Laurentide Ice Sheet culminated in a split jet stream that temporarily favoured augmented precipitation and growth of the IIS. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

For the last glacial period, ice core studies have revealed strong coupling of the largest millennial-scale warm events in Antarctica with the longest Dansgaard-Oeschger events in Greenland through the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. It has been unclear, however, whether the shorter Dansgaard-Oeschger events have counterparts in the shorter and less prominent Antarctic temperature variations, and whether these events are linked by the same mechanism. Here we present a glacial climate record derived from an ice core from Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, which represents South Atlantic climate at a resolution comparable with the Greenland ice core records. After methane synchronization with an ice core from North Greenland, the oxygen isotope record from the Dronning Maud Land ice core shows a one-to-one coupling between all Antarctic warm events and Greenland Dansgaard-Oeschger events by the bipolar seesaw6. The amplitude of the Antarctic warm events is found to be linearly dependent on the duration of the concurrent stadial in the North, suggesting that they all result from a similar reduction in the meridional overturning circulation.},

Although potentially applicable in every discipline, the amount of training in mathematics that students typically receive varies greatly between different disciplines. In those disciplines where most researchers do not master mathematics, the use of mathematics may be held in too much awe. To demonstrate this I conducted an online experiment with 200 participants, all of which had experience of reading research reports and a postgraduate degree (in any subject). Participants were presented with the abstracts from two published papers (one in evolutionary anthropology and one in sociology). Based on these abstracts, participants were asked to judge the quality of the research. Either one or the other of the two abstracts was manipulated through the inclusion of an extra sentence taken from a completely unrelated paper and presenting an equation that made no sense in the context. The abstract that included the meaningless mathematics tended to be judged of higher quality. However, this "nonsense math effect" was not found among participants with degrees in mathematics, science, technology or medicine.},

  abstract     = {Earth history is punctuated by events during which large volumes of mafic magmas were generated and emplaced by processes distinct from "normal" seafloor spreading and subduction-related magmatism. Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) of Mesozoic and Cenozoic age are the best preserved, and comprise continental flood basalts, volcanic rifted margins, oceanic plateaus, ocean basin flood basalts, submarine ridges, ocean islands and seamount chains. Paleozoic and Proterozoic LIPs are typically more deeply eroded and are recognized by their exposed plumbing system of giant dyke swarms, sill provinces and layered intrusions. The most promising Archean LIP candidates (apart from the Fortescue and Ventersdorp platformal flood basalts) are those greenstone belts containing tholeiites with minor komatiites. Some LIPs have a substantial component of felsic rocks. Many LIPs can be linked to regional-scale uplift, continental rifting and breakup, climatic shifts that may result in extinction events, and Ni-Cu-PGE (platinum group element) ore deposits. Some current frontiers in LIP research include: (1) Testing various ma ntle plume and alternative hypotheses for the origin for LIPs. (2) Characterizing individual LIPs in terms of (a) ori ginal volume and areal extent of their combined extrusive and intrusive components, (b) melt production rates, (c) plumbing system geometry, (d) nature of the mantle source region, and (e) links with ore deposits. (3) Determining the distribution of LIPs in time (from Archean to Present) and in space (after continental reconstruction). This will allow assessment of proposed links between LIPs and supercontinent breakup, juvenile crust production, climatic excursions, and mass extinctions. It will also allow an evaluation of periodicity in the LIP record, the identification of clusters of LIPs, and postulated links with the reversal frequency of the Earth's magnetic field. (4) Comparin g the characteristics, origin and distribution of LIPs on Earth with planets lacking plate tectonics, such as Venus and Mars. Interplanetary comparison may also provide a better understanding of convective processes in the mantles of the inner planets. In order to a chieve rapid progress in these frontier areas, a global campaign is proposed, which would focus on high-precision geochronology, integrated with paleomagnetism and geochemistry. Most fundamentally, such a campaign could help hasten the determination of continental configurations in the Precambrian back to 2.5 Ga or greater. Such reconstructions are vital for the proper assessment of the LIP record, as well as providing first-order information related to all geodynamic processes. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract     = {Two small high-Arctic glaciers (Longyearbreen and Larsbreen) on Svalbard (78$\neg$$\infty$N 15$\neg$$\infty$E) were studied with respect to glaciological and hydrological characteristics. Fieldwork during the melting season of 1993 and 1994 was coupled with digital map analysis based on high-resolution digital elevation models (DEM) to reveal the dynamics and temperature regime of small glaciers in a high-Arctic environment, and its relationship to the material transport and sedimentation of these glaciers. The study showed Longyearbreen and Larsbreen to be low activity glaciers, cold-based with temperate patches, and thus having a low potential of basal erosion. The transport of ions and suspended solids in the glacial meltwater implies storage of material in and around the glacier which comes into contact with the meltwater. The study suggests that small Arctic glaciers couple the slope system with the fluvial system and therefore build a highly effective denudation system. Small polythermal glaciers are therefore important in understanding Pleistocene and Holocene landform development in cold regions.},

  abstract     = {A number of pre-Holocene submarine mass-failure events of various sizes have been recognised within the Plio-Pleistocene succession along the European margin from Lofoten to Porcupine. These may occur as canyon or debris-flow deposits, but especially as slumps and slides that may be either buried within the sedimentary column or have seabed expression. The present paper deals mostly with the larger slides and palaeoslides within the region, some of which show evidence of reactivation during the Holocene. The known geographical distribution of the palaeoslides is presented, and the best estimates for their ages proposed. The best-known zone of palaeosliding is the Storegga Slide Complex in which the most significant period of sliding was during the mid-Pleistocene and earlier. Sliding here may have been initiated during the late Pliocene, as may have been the case for the North Faroes Slide Complex. Other palaeoslides, with a variety of ages, have been identified along the European Atlantic margin from the Nyk Slide in the north to the Foreland Slide Complex and the Rockall Bank Mass Flow in the south. Several of the palaeoslides and Holocene slides are associated with glacial depocentres, for instance the North Sea, Sula Sgeir, Barra and Donegal fans. While it is speculated that there may be several causal mechanisms, most striking is the common association of the paleoslides with tectonic features, suggesting that seismic activity or other processes associated with such lineaments have had a major influence on palaeoslide distribution. ?? 2005 D.

The new data indicate that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) extended to the shelf edge of Pine Island Bay during the last glaciation, and was drained by a grounded, fast-flowing palaeo-ice stream through this outer-shelf trough. Topography and subglacial geology are likely to have exerted a strong control on the development and location of palaeo-ice streams in Pine Island Bay. TOPAS records show that mega-scale glacial lineations are formed in an acoustically transparent sediment layer interpreted to be soft till and are inferred to be the product of subglacial sediment deformation beneath the palaeo-ice stream. The flat to irregular nature of the basal reflector of the acoustically transparent layer of soft till implies that a combination of groove-ploughing of the substrate and subglacial sediment deformation were important processes beneath the palaeo-ice stream in the outer trough of Pine Island Bay, as well as palaeo-ice streams elsewhere in Antarctica. Therefore, the formation of the soft till layer, and possibly associated subglacial bedforms, are likely to be a function of these palaeo-ice stream processes. In a regional context, the WAIS extended to the continental shelf edge of the Bellingshausen, Amundsen and Ross Seas, and was drained by a number of palaeo-ice streams during the last glaciation. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {Some areas within ice sheet boundaries retain pre-existing landforms and thus either remained as ice free islands (nunataks) during glaciation, or were preserved under ice. Differentiating between these alternatives has significant implications for paleoenvironment, ice sheet surface elevation, and ice volume reconstructions. In the northern Swedish mountains, in situ cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al concentrations from glacial erratics on relict surfaces as well as glacially eroded bedrock adjacent to these surfaces, provide consistent last deglaciation exposure ages ({\~{}}8-13 kyr), confirming ice sheet overriding as opposed to ice free conditions. However, these ages contrast with exposure ages of 34-61 kyr on bedrock surfaces in these same relict areas, demonstrating that relict areas were preserved with little erosion through multiple glacial cycles. Based on the difference in radioactive decay between 26Al and 10Be, the measured nuclide concentration in one of these bedrock surfaces suggests that it remained largely unmodified for a minimum period of 845+461
-418 kyr. These results indicate that relict areas need to be accounted for as frozen bed patches in basal boundary conditions for ice sheet models, and in landscape development models. Subglacial preservation also implies that source areas for glacial sediments in ocean cores are considerably smaller than the total area covered by ice sheets. These relict areas also have significance as potential long-term subglacial biologic refugia. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {There is increasing evidence for mid mantle seismic anisotropy around subduction zones whose interpretation remains elusive. In this study I estimate the strain-induced mid mantle fabric and associated seismic anisotropy developing in 3D petrological-thermo-mechanical subduction models where the slab is either stagnating over the 660. km discontinuity or penetrating into the lower mantle. The modelling of synthetic lattice-preferred-orientation (LPO) development of wadsleyite and perovskite has been calibrated with results from deformational experiments and ab-initio atomic scale models, and the single crystal elastic tensor of the different mineral phases is scaled by local P-T conditions. The lower transition zone (ringwoodite + garnet) is assumed to be isotropic. Mid mantle fabric develops in proximity of the subducting slab where deformation and stresses are high, except at depths where upwelling or downwelling material undergoes phase transformations, yielding to LPO reset. The upper transition zone (wadsleyite. +. garnet) is characterized by weak transverse isotropy (2-3{\%}) with symmetry axes oriented and fast S wave polarized dip-normal. A slightly stronger transverse isotropy develops in the lower mantle (perovskite. +. periclase), where the symmetry axes, the polarization of the fast S wave and the maximum Vp and dVs are parallel to the slab dip and subduction direction. For stagnating slab models this translates into negative and positive radial anisotropy in the upper transition zone and lower mantle back-arc, respectively, minimum delay times for vertically travelling shear waves and large shear wave splitting for waves propagating horizontally in the lower mantle. These results may help in reconciling the seismic anisotropy patterns observed in some subduction zones with subduction-induced deformation, such as those measured in the mid mantle between the Australian plate and the New Hebrides-Tonga-Kermadec trenches that I interpret as related to stagnating portions of the subducted Pacific plate. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract     = {The geological and geophysical phenomena associated with water in the slab can be grouped into three different categories: those related to 1) the storage of water in the oceanic lithosphere at the surface, 2) the subduction of a hydrated slab and 3) its dehydration that ultimately leads to mantle regassing. Widespread hydration of the uppermost oceanic lithosphere occurs at mid-ocean ridges and more pervasively at the trench-rise system in response to bending-related fracturing and faulting. The amount of water stored in the upper lithosphere appears to be proportional to the spreading slowness and amount of bending. Hydrothermal alteration of the oceanic plate may also occur more locally along transform margins, fracture zones and volcanic ridges. Subduction of a hydrated slab should be observed from a reduction of seismic velocities, anomalous Vp/Vs ratios and seismic anisotropy in its uppermost portions, and shift of the main phase transformation boundaries characteristic of the mantle. Because of the increased buoyancy and weakness, hydrated or wet slabs should tend to stagnate over the 660. km discontinuity, favoring layered mantle convection patterns. Slab dehydration takes place according to the plate thermal regime function of the slab age and sinking velocity. Hydrous minerals in the oceanic crust and mantle are stable down to a maximum of 300. km and 1200. km depth, respectively, after which minor amounts of water can be retained in nominally anhydrous minerals. There is abundant geophysical evidence for dehydration of the slab crust and sub-Moho mantle, while fragmentary and often indirect evidence supports the presence of water in the lower plane of the Double Seismic Zone and at depths {\textgreater}. 300. km. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract     = {The Mediterranean offers a unique opportunity to study the driving forces of tectonic deformation within a complex mobile belt. Lithospheric dynamics are affected by slab rollback and collision of two large, slowly moving plates, forcing fragments of continental and oceanic lithosphere to interact. This paper reviews the rich and growing set of constraints from geological reconstructions, geodetic data, and crustal and upper mantle heterogeneity imaged by structural seismology. We proceed to discuss a conceptual and quantitative framework for the causes of surface deformation. Exploring existing and newly developed tectonic and numerical geodynamic models, we illustrate the role of mantle convection on surface geology. A coherent picture emerges which can be outlined by two, almost symmetric, upper mantle convection cells. The downwellings are found in the center of the Mediterranean and are associated with the descent of the Tyrrhenian and the Hellenic slabs. During plate convergence, these slabs migrated backward with respect to the Eurasian upper plate, inducing a return flow of the asthenosphere from the back-arc regions toward the subduction zones. This flow can be found at large distance from the subduction zones and is at present expressed in two upwellings beneath Anatolia and eastern Iberia. This convection system provides an explanation for the general pattern of seismic anisotropy in the Mediterranean, first-order Anatolia, and Adria microplate kinematics and may contribute to the high elevation of scarcely deformed areas such as Anatolia and eastern Iberia. More generally, the Mediterranean is an illustration of how upper mantle, small-scale convection leads to intraplate deformation and complex plate boundary reconfiguration at the westernmost terminus of the Tethyan collision.},

  abstract   = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein$-$protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD $\leq$ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

If terrestrial plant macrofossils are also absent, the dating of bulk sediment often provides the only means to establish chronologies for these problematic sediment sequences. Given that chironomid (non-biting midge) remains are sufficiently abundant in many northern lakes to be C-14-dated via the accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) method, we decided to explore their utility in age-model development. Five age determinations based on chironomid material were obtained from a lake sediment core sampled in the shrub tundra of northern Quebec. These results were compared to six AMS bulk sediment ages, as well as to a date obtained from Drepanocladus spp. The chironomids yielded consistently younger ages ( with increasing age offset upcore), confirming both the presence of a reservoir effect and the value of chironomids in establishing more reliable C-14 chronologies},

  abstract     = {Seismic stratification of the upper mantle is investigated by applying two complementary techniques to the records of the Graefenberg array in southern Germany. The anisotropic P receiver function technique (Kosarev et al. 1984; Vinnik {\&} Montagner 1996) is modified by using summary seismic events instead of individual events and different weighting functions instead of the same function for the harmonic angular analysis of the SV and T components of the Pds phases. The summary events provide better separation of the second azimuthal harmonic than the individual events. The parameters of the second harmonics of SV and T thus evaluated should be similar if they reflect the effects of azimuthal anisotropy. This can be used as a criterion to identify the anisotropy. To detect the Sdp phases and their azimuthal variations caused by azimuthal anisotropy we have developed a stacking technique, which can be termed the S receiver function technique It includes axis rotation to separate interfering P and S arrivals, determination of the principal (M) component of the S-wave motion, deconvolution of the P components of many recordings by their respective M components and stacking of the deconvolved P components with weights depending on the level of noise and the angle between the M direction and the backazimuth of the event. Both techniques yield consistent results for the Graefenberg array. As indicated by the P receiver functions, the upper layer of the mantle between the Moho and 80 km depth is anisotropic with dVs/Vs around 0.03 and the fast direction close to 20{$^{\circ}$} clockwise from north. The fast direction of anisotropy below this layer is around 110{$^{\circ}$}, The boundary between the upper and the lower anisotropic layers is manifested by the detectable Pds and Sdp converted phases. Shear wave splitting in SKS is strongly dominated by azimuthal anisotropy in the lower layer (asthenosphere).},

A similar sequence of events is recognized in New Zealand. In both regions Middle Cambrian volcanic rocks are interpreted as arc/back-arc assemblages produced by west-directed subduction; sediments interbedded with the volcanic rocks show provenance both from the arc and from the Gondwana margin and therefore place the basin close to the continent. Rapid back-arc closure in the Late Cambrian was likely accomplished through changes to the subduction system. ?? 2008 International Association for Gondwana Research.},

  abstract     = {We processed a large number of vertical-component seismograms recorded by broadband seismic stations in and around China and ultimately retrieved similar to 33 140 regional and similar to 10 360 teleseismic fundamental-mode group-velocity measurements at 40 s periods, with fewer measurements for shorter and longer periods. We directly inverted the processed group-velocity measurements for a three-dimensional lithospheric S-velocity model of the Chinese mainland. Synthetic test results and data fit or misfit analysis demonstrated the reliability of our surface-wave tomographic inversion. The imaged upper-crustal low velocities are consistent with variations in sediment thickness; for example, the Tarim Basin, which contains a great thickness of sediments, is characterized by a strong, shallow, low-velocity anomaly. High lithospheric velocities are observed to varying depths in the North China Craton, Yangtze Craton, and Tarim Craton, indicating varying thicknesses of the lithosphere beneath these cratonic areas. Low asthenospheric velocities are widely imaged in eastern and southern China, around the Tarim Basin, and along a roughly north-south belt in central China. The low asthenospheric velocities in eastern and southern China are attributed to partial melting of a subducted slab associated with the westward subduction of an oceanic plate, while those in central China and around the Tarim Basin are attributed to Indian-Eurasian collision.},

  abstract     = {Early geophysical studies hypothesized a continental rift structure beneath the Wilkes Subglacial Basin. Recent models favour a flexural origin for the basin linked to Transantarctic Mountains uplift and to East Antarctic Craton lithospheric rigidity. Flexural modelling predicts crustal thickening beneath the basin. Gravity modelling along the International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expedition traverse (1998/99), however, reveals crustal thinning beneath the basin. At 75{$^{\circ}$}S the crust thins from 37 km beneath the Transantarctic Mountains to 31 $\pm$ 2 km beneath the Wilkes Basin. The western flank of the basin features a sharp magnetic break. This signature may arise from a fault separating highly magnetic Precambrian craton crust from weakly magnetic Neoproterozoic(?) crust. Much later crustal extension may have focussed along the craton margin. The eastern flank of the Wilkes Basin exhibits a prominent aeromagnetic signature. Potential field modelling predicts 1-4 km thick sedimentary infill within the Wilkes extended terrane, interpreted mainly as Beacon Supergroup intruded by Jurassic Ferrar tholeiites. The adjacent Adventure Subglacial Trench is a narrow rift basin with 25$\pm$5 km thick crust and a 10$\pm$4 km sedimentary infill. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {The Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains are the least understood tectonic feature on Earth, because they are completely hidden beneath the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. Their high elevation and youthful Alpine topography, combined with their location on the East Antarctic craton, creates a paradox that has puzzled researchers since the mountains were discovered in 19581. The preservation of Alpine topography in the Gamburtsevs2 may reflect extremely low long-term erosion rates beneath the ice sheet3, but the mountains' origin remains problematic. Here we present the first comprehensive view of the crustal architecture and uplift mechanisms for the Gamburtsevs, derived from radar, gravity and magnetic data. The geophysical data define a 2,500-km-long rift system in East Antarctica surrounding the Gamburtsevs, and a thick crustal root4 beneath the range. We propose that the root formed during the Proterozoic assembly of interior East Antarctica (possibly about 1\hspace{0.167em}Gyr ago), was preserved as in some old orogens5, 6 and was rejuvenated during much later Permian (roughly 250\hspace{0.167em}Myr ago) and Cretaceous (roughly 100\hspace{0.167em}Myr ago) rifting. Much like East Africa7, the interior of East Antarctica is a mosaic of Precambrian provinces affected by rifting processes. Our models show that the combination of rift-flank uplift, root buoyancy and the isostatic response to fluvial and glacial erosion explains the high elevation and relief of the Gamburtsevs. The evolution of the Gamburtsevs demonstrates that rifting and preserved orogenic roots can produce broad regions of high topography in continental interiors without significantly modifying the underlying Precambrian lithosphere.},

  abstract     = {Integration of data from fully cored stratigraphic holes with an extensive grid of seismic reflection lines in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, has allowed the formulation of a new model for the evolution of the Cenozoic Victoria Land Basin of the West Antarctic Rift. The Early Rift phase (Eocene to Early Oligocene) is recorded by wedges of strata confined by early extensional faults, and which contain seismic facies consistent with drainage via coarse-grained fans and deltas into discrete, actively subsiding grabens and half-grabens. The Main Rift phase (Early Oligocene to Early Miocene) is represented by a lens of strata that thickens symmetrically from the basin margins into a central depocenter, and in which stratal events pass continuously over the top of the Early Rift extensional topography. Internal seismic facies and lithofacies indicate a more organized, cyclical shallow marine succession, influenced increasingly upward by cycles of glacial advance and retreat into the basin. The Passive Thermal Subsidence phase (Early Middle Miocene) is recorded by an evenly distributed sheet of strata that thickens somewhat into the depocentre but is continuous across and over the earlier rift strata to the margins of the basin. Internally, it contains similar facies to the underlying Main Rift, but preserves more evidence for clinoform sets and large channels, and in core comprises many short, condensed and strongly top-truncated stratal cycles with continued, periodic glacial influence. These patterns are interpreted to record accumulation under similar environmental conditions but in a regime of slower subsidence. The Renewed Rifting phase (Middle Miocene to Recent, largely unsampled by coring thus far) is represented by intervals that thicken significantly into the basin depocentre and that are complicated by evidence of magmatic activity (McMurdo Volcanic Group). This succession is further divided into lower and upper intervals, separated by a major unconformity that displays increasing angular discordance towards the western basin margin and Transantarctic Mountain Front. The youngest part of the stratigraphy was accumulated under the influence of flexural loading imposed by the construction of large volcanic edifices, and was formed in an environment in which little sediment was supplied from the western basin margin, suggesting a change in environmental (glacial) conditions at possibly c. 2??Ma. The Cenozoic stratigraphy of the southern Victoria Land Basin preserves archives of both climate change and the complex rift history of the basin, and coincidences between key stratal surfaces in seismic data and evidence for environmental change in drillcores suggest that tectonic and climatic drivers may be causally linked. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {A carbon-rich black layer, dating to approximately 12.9 ka, has been previously identified at approximately 50 Clovis-age sites across North America and appears contemporaneous with the abrupt onset of Younger Dryas (YD) cooling. The in situ bones of extinct Pleistocene megafauna, along with Clovis tool assemblages, occur below this black layer but not within or above it. Causes for the extinctions, YD cooling, and termination of Clovis culture have long been controversial. In this paper, we provide evidence for an extraterrestrial (ET) impact event at approximately equal 12.9 ka, which we hypothesize caused abrupt environmental changes that contributed to YD cooling, major ecological reorganization, broad-scale extinctions, and rapid human behavioral shifts at the end of the Clovis Period. Clovis-age sites in North American are overlain by a thin, discrete layer with varying peak abundances of (i) magnetic grains with iridium, (ii) magnetic microspherules, (iii) charcoal, (iv) soot, (v) carbon spherules, (vi) glass-like carbon containing nanodiamonds, and (vii) fullerenes with ET helium, all of which are evidence for an ET impact and associated biomass burning at approximately 12.9 ka. This layer also extends throughout at least 15 Carolina Bays, which are unique, elliptical depressions, oriented to the northwest across the Atlantic Coastal Plain. We propose that one or more large, low-density ET objects exploded over northern North America, partially destabilizing the Laurentide Ice Sheet and triggering YD cooling. The shock wave, thermal pulse, and event-related environmental effects (e.g., extensive biomass burning and food limitations) contributed to end-Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions and adaptive shifts among PaleoAmericans in North America.},

The new images incorporate data from the recent Tasmal experiment, improving resolution in continental Australia. Through comparisons with surface geology and geochemical studies, it is possible to infer that the steps in lithospheric thickness are related to boundaries between blocks of different age. The westernmost boundary marks the edge of the Archaean to Early-Proterozoic core of the continent. A second lithospheric boundary is observed in the central part of east Australia. To the west of this line, geochemical evidence suggests that there is Proterozoic lithospheric mantle, and this boundary may therefore represent the change from Proterozoic to Phanerozoic basement. The structure on the eastern margin of the continent is dominated by slow velocities, suggesting that in this area the continental lithosphere is very thin. There is a strong correlation between the slow wave speeds and the location of both the highest topography and recent volcanic activity. Inland of the continental margin, a zone of strong gradients in the seismic wave speed is observed, indicating a distinct step in lithospheric structure. If the step in lithospheric thickness was in place prior to volcanism, it may have acted as a boundary, with volcanism mainly occurring beneath the thinner lithosphere to the east.},

New data from the WACRATON and TIGGER experiments are integrated with re-processed data from previous temporary deployments of broad-band seismometers and permanent seismic stations. The much improved path coverage in critical regions allows an interpretation of structures in the west of Australia, and a detailed comparison between different cratonic regions. Improvements to the waveform inversion procedure and a new multi-scale tomographic method increase the reliability of the tomographic images. In the shallowest part of the model (75 km) a region of lowered velocity is imaged beneath central Australia, and confirmed by the delayed arrival times of body waves for short paths. Within the cratonic lithosphere there is clearly structure at scale lengths of a few hundred kilometres; resolution tests indicate that path coverage within the continent is sufficient to reveal features of this size in the upper part of our model. In Western Australia, differences are seen beneath and within the Archaean cratons: at depths greater than 150 km faster velocities are imaged beneath the Yilgarn Craton than beneath the Pilbara Craton. In the complex North Australian Craton a fast wavespeed anomaly continuing to at least 250 km is observed below parts of the craton, suggesting the possibility of Archaean lithosphere underlying areas of dominantly Proterozoic surface geology. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

During uplift, the crust remained at constant thickness or was slightly thickened by magmatic underplating. In contrast, the crust beneath the Ross Embayment has been extended and consequently thinned beginning in the Late Cretaceous but mainly during Cenozoic times. We suggest here that the uplift of the Transantarctic Mountains and the subsidence of the Ross Embayment are a result of passive rifting governed by a fundamental structural asymmetry defined by a shallow crustal penetrative detachment zone that dips westward beneath the Transantarctic Mountain Front. The localization and asymmetry of this detachment and its unusually deep level expression are attributed to a profound crustal anisotropy inherited from an early Palaeozoic collision along the present site of the mountain range. ?? 1986.},

It is unclear whether the Prydz Belt involved ocean closure or regionalscale transcurrent tectonics, but it does juxtapose numerous terranes with different geological histories, and it seems likely that the East Antarctic Shield behaved as a collage rather than a keystone during the amalgamation of Gondwana. Increasing evidence that East Gondwana underwent significant reorganisation during the Cambrian requires changes to current models for both the assembly of Gondwana and the configuration of the late Mesoproterozoic supercontinent of Rodinia.R{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}} On supposait g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}ralement que la tectonique dans l'Est-Antarctique s'{\'{e}}tait restreinte au N{\'{e}}oprot{\'{e}}rozo{\"{i}}que sup{\'{e}}rieur-Cambrien {\`{a}} l'Orog{\`{e}}ne de Ross, situ{\'{e}} sur la bordure pal{\'{e}}o-pacifique du bouclier pr{\'{e}}cambrien, mais il est clair {\`{a}} pr{\'{e}}sent que deux cha{\^{i}}nes d'{\^{a}}ge [`]pan-africain' recoupent le Bouclier Est-Antarctique: les cha{\^{i}}nes de L{\"{u}}tzow Holm et de Prydz.

  abstract     = {Three Precambrian basement provinces extend from the southern coast of Australia into East Antarctica when reconstructed in a Gondwana configuration. These are, from east to west, the Mawson Craton, and the Albany-Fraser and Pinjarra Orogens. The Mawson Craton preserves evidence for tectonic activity from the late Archaean until the earliest Mesoproterozoic. It is exposed in the Gawler Craton of South Australia, the Terre Ad{\'{e}}lie and King George V Land coastline of East Antarctica, and the Miller Range of the central Transantarctic Mountains. It may form a significant part of the ice-covered East Antarctic Shield, although insufficient data are available to constrain its lateral extent. The Mawson Craton underwent late Palaeoproterozoic tectonism along its eastern margin (the Kimban Orogeny) and the occurrence of c. 1700Ma eclogites in the Transantarctic Mountains implies that this was, in part, a collisional event, although elsewhere it was characterized by low P/T metamorphism. The western margin of the Mawson Craton collided with a continental fragment comprising the Nawa Domain of the Gawler Craton, the Coompana Block and the Nornalup Complex of Western Australia at c. 1560Ma during the Kararan Orogeny. The western edge of the Nornalup Complex later collided with the Biranup and Fraser Complexes and Yilgarn Craton to form the Albany-Fraser Orogen during two stages of tectonism at c. 1350--1260 and 1210--1140Ma. The Pinjarra Orogen truncates the western margin of the Yilgarn Craton and Albany-Fraser Orogen, and contains allochthonous 1100--1000Ma gneissic blocks transported along the craton margin during at least two stages of Neoproterozoic transcurrent movement. It divides East Gondwana into Australo-Antarctic and Indo-Antarctic domains, which are distinct continental fragments with different Proterozoic histories that were juxtaposed by oblique collision at 550--500Ma during the assembly of Gondwana. The path taken by the Pinjarra Orogen beneath the Antarctic ice sheet is unknown, but it is of similar width and length to the East African Orogen, and must have been a fundamental Neoproterozoic boundary of critical importance to supercontinent assembly and breakup.},

  abstract     = {Fennoscandia has experienced major uplift in postglacial time, which is assumed to reflect a glacial isostatic process connected to the melting of the last ice sheets. Extensive modelling of the isostatic movements show that the applied deglaciation and uplift model fit the observations well. There are, however, areas with significant deviations between uplift measurements and regional model predictions. The misfit between observations and the isostatic uplift modelling is interpreted here to reflect a tectonic component of the uplift. The objective of the present investigation is to isolate this tectonic uplift component. Interestingly enough, the areas found partly correspond to areas with pronounced seismic activity, and the assumption that the postglacial rebound is responsible for much of the observed onshore seismicity is substantiated. We conclude that there seems to be present-day deformation along the shoreline of mid-Norway, southern Norway (shoreline and mountain areas), and along the Swedish east coast with the centre northeast of the Gulf of Bothnia that cannot be explained by glacial isostasy. Not all of the deformations in these areas are necessarily co-seismic. The study suggests that such vertical deformations are small in magnitude and overprint the glacial rebound. The deformations may be a consequence of the Plio-Pleistocene erosional pattern, which is of glacial origin. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract     = {The Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains of East Antarctica are among Earth's most enigmatic mountain ranges. They are situated in the middle of Antarctica, buried under hundreds of meters of ice, and reach an elevation of more than 3000 m. These characteristics have given rise to speculation about their origin and composition, in particular whether they are a hotspot or remnants of ancient orogenic events. We studied fluvio-deltaic sands from ODP Site 1166 in Prydz Bay which were deposited prior to the onset of East Antarctic glaciation to address the question of their origin. Results for U-Pb dating of detrital zircons reveal an important age population of similar to 530 Ma, which is accompanied by a dominant Ar-40/Ar-39 age population of similar to 519 Ma for detrital hornblendes. The data show no sign of young volcanic contributions, suggesting an old continental origin of the mountains, leaving as enigmatic the cause of their great height and size.

  abstract     = {The source of buoyancy for the uplift of cratonic plateaus is a fundamental question in continental dynamics. The {\~{}}1.9 km uplift of the Colorado Plateau since the Late Cretaceous is a prime example of this problem. We used apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronometry (230 analyses; 36 samples) to provide the first single-system, regional-scale proxy for the unroofing history of the southwestern quadrant of the plateau. The results confirm overall southwest to northeast unroofing, from plateau margin to plateau interior. A single phase of unroofing along the plateau margin in Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary (Sevier- Laramide) time contrasts with multiphase unroofing of the southwestern plateau interior in Early and mid- to Late Tertiary time. The Early Cretaceous was characterized by northeastward tilting and regional erosion, followed by aggradation of $\geq$1500 m of Upper Cretaceous sediments along the eroded plateau margin. Sevier-Laramide denudation affected the entire southwestern plateau, was concentrated along the plateau margin, and migrated from northwest to southeast. Following a period of relative stability of the landscape from ca. 50--30 Ma, significant unroofing of the southwestern plateau interior occurred between ca. 28 and 16 Ma. Additional denudation north of the Grand Canyon took place in latest Tertiary time. Mid-Tertiary dates from the Grand Canyon basement at the bottom of the Upper Granite Gorge limit significant incision of the modern Grand Canyon below the Kaibab surface to {\textless}23 Ma. Modeling the age distributions of samples from the basement and Kaibab surface nearby suggests that the gorge and the plateau surface had similar Early to mid-Tertiary thermal histories, despite their {\textgreater}1500m difference in vertical structural position. If these models are correct, they indicate that a {\textquotedblleft}proto--Grand Canyon{\textquotedblright} of kilometer-scale depth had incised post-Paleozoic strata by the Early Eocene. Evidence for kilometer-scale mid-Tertiary relief in northeast-flowing drainages along the plateau margin, as well as the mid-Tertiary episode of plateau interior unroofing, imply that the southwestern plateau interior had attained substantial elevation by at least 25--20 Ma, if not much earlier. These observations are inconsistent with any model calling for exclusively Late Tertiary uplift of the southwestern plateau. Sevier-Laramide plateau surface uplift and incision thus result from one or more processes that enhanced the buoyancy of the plateau lithosphere, expanding the Cordillera's orogenic highlands into its low-standing cratonic foreland. The onset of the Laramide slab's demise at ca. 40 Ma and the major pulse of extension in the Basin and Range from ca. 16--10 Ma appear to have had little influence on the denudation history of the southwestern plateau. In contrast, the post-Laramide unroofing episodes may be explained by drainage adjustments induced by rift-related lowering of regions adjacent to the plateau, without the need to otherwise modify the plateau lithosphere. Our data do not preclude a large component of post--Early Eocene elevation gain (or the geodynamic mechanisms it may imply), but they do point toward Laramide-age buoyancy sources as the initial cause of significant surface uplift, ending more than 500 m.y. of residence near sea level.},

The key idea is the use of shaping regularization to constrain the variability of nonstationary regression coefficients. Simple computational experiments demonstrate advantages of shaping regularization over classic Tikhonov's regularization, including a more intuitive selection of parameters and a faster iterative convergence. Using benchmark synthetic data examples, I have successfully applied this method to the problem of adaptive subtraction of multiple reflections.},

We present new Holocene relative sea-level data from Franz Josef Land and northern Novaya Zemlya, Russia, that place the thickest glacier loads in the northern Barents Sea and not over Novaya Zemlya. Radiocarbon ages from shelf and terrestrial areas at the former ice-sheet margin support deglaciation of the northern Barents Sea between 13.0 and 10.3 ka, considerably later than inferred from isotopic records for the Arctic Ocean. This analysis indicates that the Barents Sea ice sheet was a dominant sea-level reservoir in northern Eurasia, and that glacier loading of Novaya Zemlya was comparatively limited during the last glaciation.},

Previously described tills were not identified in sections exposed along the northeast shore of Phipps{\o}ya, but instead sublittoral sediments with rock-fall concentrations derived from the adjacent slope. A glacio-isostati- cally higher sea level b40 ka deposited sublittoral sediment and is possibly correlative to a deglacial event in oxygen isotope stage 4 or 5 identified at other sites on Svalbard. The postglacial marine limit is 221m aht and occurs as an escarpment or washing limit into a stony drift. This drift contains granite and quartzite erra- tics from Nordaustlandet that indicate coverage by a northward flowing ice sheet during the Late Weichselian. Datable material on the raised-beach sequence was rare and a 14C age of c. 9.2 ka on an articulated Balanus balanus from 10m aht provides a minimum constraining age on the marine limit. A mild transgression oc- curred by 6.2 ka, with sea level falling close to present levels by c. 5.0 ka. The zone of zero emergence (hinge line) lies 10 to 20 km north of Sju{\o}yane and is approximately coincident with the last glacial maximum limit on the continental shelf. There is an approximately 75 to100 km offset between observed and modelled zone of zero emergence, indicating a need to refine earth rheology-based ice-sheet models.},

  abstract     = {The pattern of postglacial emergence in the Barents Sea is pivotal to constraining the timing of deglaciation and extent and thickness of the last ice sheet in northern Eurasia. This review unites records of Holocene relative sea level from Svalbard, Franz Josef Land, and Novaya Zemlya to better understand the geometries of past ice sheet loads. Emergence data from northern Eurasia confine the maximum area of glacier loading to the northwestern Barents Sea, where {\textgreater}100m of emergence is measured on Kongs??ya. Deglacial unloading commenced on western and northern Spitsbergen c. 13-1214Ckaago, and by c. 10.514Cka on eastern Svalbard and more distal sites on Franz Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya. The marine limit phase (c. 13-1214Cka) on western and northern Spitsbergen is characterized by the construction of spits indicating a dominance of long-shore drift over storm-generated fetch, reflecting extensive sea-ice coverage of coastal areas. At sites in proximity to the ice sheet margin on western and northern Spitsbergen there is evidence for a transgressive-regressive cycle c. 6-414Cka, possibly reflecting back migration of displaced mantle material. A modern transgression is inferred from the marine erosion of 17\textsuperscript{th} century cultural features and 14C ages of whalebone and terrestrial peat buried by modern storm gravels that place sea level at its present position by c. 2 to 1ka ago. The greatest observed emergence on Franz Josef Land occurs on Bell Island, with a marine limit at 49m aht, formed c. {\textgreater}1014Cka. Available emergence data since 9ka show rising strandlines toward the southwest at ???0.3m/km. The northern limit of emergence on Franz Josef Land is poorly constrained because relative sea-level data is sparse north of 80??30???N. In contrast to Svalbard and Franz Josef Land, the marine limit on northern Novaya Zemlya is only 10-15m above high tide and formed between 6.5 and 5.014Cka when global sea level was stabilizing. All sites show little apparent emergence during the past 2ka, with the youngest raised landforms at identical heights to storm beaches. This minimal glacio-isostatic signature on Novaya Zemlya and on Vaygach Island, where deglaciation commenced {\textgreater}10ka ago, indicates ice sheet thicknesses of {\textless}1.5km. The spatial variation in emergence for the Barents Sea indicates that western and northern Spitsbergen and Novaya Zemlya were near the reactive margin of the ice sheet and these areas sustained the briefest ice coverage (2-6ka) and were probably not in isostatic equilibrium. In contrast, central and eastern Svalbard and southern Franz Josef Land were beneath a substantial ice load and probably sustained this load for c. 1014Cka and achieved isostatic equilibrium. Isostasy residual from an ice sheet model portrays well the general pattern of uplift and load response at the centre of ice sheets, but deviates substantial at the ice sheet margin or areas covered by thin ice, like Novaya Zemlya. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The model set-up with present-day climatology modified by a glacial index brings forth an areally correct Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) extent in the western areas, but the ice-sheet volume is too small compared to reconstructions from rebound rates. Applying modified climate data results in similar extent as indicated by the Quaternary Environment of the Eurasian North (QUEEN) Late Weichselian ice-sheet reconstruction. The simulation results display freshwater fluxes from melting and calving in phase with Heinrich events H3 at 27, H2 at 22, and H1 at 14 ka ago. These peaks correspond to fast flow areas, with main activity at 27 and 22 ka ago in the Nordic Channel area and later in the Bear Island and Storfjorden region. The activity of these areas seems to be shifting from south to north from LGM to the Holocene. The freshwater pulse at 19-18.5 ka could correspond to Dansgaard-Oeschger oscillation, as well as ice volume flux peaks around 18-17 ka ago on the western margin of the ice sheet. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract     = {Mantle flow models based on seismic tomographic images of 3-D mantle structure may be used to successfully explain a wide range of global surface data related to mantle convection. These tomography-based convection models place strong constraints on viscosity and lateral density variations in Earth's mantle. The convection-related observables which can be modelled include the global free-air gravity anomalies, the dynamic surface and CMB topography, and the horizontal divergence of the present-day tectonic plate motions. The fundamental mantle flow theory needed to interpret these geodynamic observables is reviewed for the case of a self-gravitating, compressible mantle with coupled surface plates. The most important input to the flow models, namely the effective viscosity of the mantle, may be inferred from simultaneous inversions of glacial-isostatic adjustment and mantle convection data. These viscosity inferences are used in numerical calculations of the geodynamic response or kernel functions which provide the theoretical relationship between the surface observables and the mantle density anomalies. Understanding the present-day dynamics of the mantle is critically dependent on knowledge of these internal density perturbations and they are derived here on the basis of a wide selection of recent S-wave tomography models. A detailed review of the geodynamic observables predicted on the basis of these S-wave tomography models is presented and it is found that all tomography models provide very similar fits to the convection data. An outstanding issue in current efforts to understand mantle flow dynamics is the relative importance of the thermally and compositionally generated buoyancy in the mantle. Joint shear and bulk-sound tomography models are employed to resolve lateral variations in the theoretical scaling between mantle density and seismic velocity anomalies and thereby detect compositional heterogeneity in the mantle. A similar analysis of the fast/cold and slow/hot regions in the S-wave tomography models also provides indications of significant lateral variations in composition. The most anomalous regions appear to be the shallow subcontinental mantle, the mid-mantle region near 1500. km depth, and the seismic D??? layer. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Most of the slope failures occurred during three periods at c. 9650 cal. BP, 8350---8200 cal. BP and 3000 cal. BP. Suggested factors causing instability of the slopes include earthquake activity resulting from rapid isostatic uplift, excess pore pressure caused by relative sea-level fall and/or the presence of gas as well as climatic changes. Mass-transport deposits at the mouth of an incision at the southern slope of Svensksunddjupet are suggested to mainly relate to runoff from the land-based glacier Vardebreen. The increase of the mass-transport activity may indicate that Vardebreen either formed or increased in size at c. 7000 cal. BP.},

  abstract     = {Multi-proxy analyses of two sediment cores from central Isfjorden were used to reconstruct the glacial history in central Spitsbergen during the Late Weichselian and the Holocene, and to relate iceberg rafting and sea-ice rafting to climatic and oceanographic changes in the north Atlantic region. A basal till was deposited beneath an ice stream prior to 12,700 cal. years BP (calendar years before the present). Several tidewater glaciers influenced the sedimentary environment during the Younger Dryas and probably already during the Aller??d. The Younger Dryas cooling might be reflected by enhanced sea-ice formation and suspension settling, as well as reduced iceberg rafting. The final deglaciation was dominated by intense iceberg rafting. It terminated around 11,200 cal. years BP. Optimum Holocene climatic and oceanographic conditions with significantly reduced ice rafting occurred between c. 11,200 and 9000 cal. years BP. Ice rafting occurred almost exclusively from icebergs after 10,200 cal. years BP. The icebergs most probably originated from tidewater glaciers on east Spitsbergen, indicating the presence of a strong east-west temperature gradient at this time. An increase of iceberg rafting around 9000 cal. years BP, followed by enhanced sea-ice rafting, reflects the onset of a general cooling in the western Barents Sea-Svalbard region. Comparatively intense rafting from icebergs and sea ice between 9000 and 4000 cal. years BP is related to this cooling. A general reduction in ice rafting after 4000 cal. years BP is most probably the result of the enhanced formation of shore-fast and/or more permanent sea-ice cover, reducing the drift of icebergs and sea ice in the fjord. The results indicate that the palaeoenvironmental conditions on central Spitsbergen to a large degree depended on the oceanographic conditions in the western Barents Sea and west off Spitsbergen. However, climatic trends affecting Greenland and the entire north Atlantic region can also be identified. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Regardless of the final outcome, the present vigorous debate is to be welcomed since it is likely to stimulate new discoveries in a way that unquestioning acceptance of the conventional plume model will not.},

These rocks are more than 500 million years older than the oldest previously dated rocks from the Gawler Craton, and challenge the view that pre-3.0 Ga crust in Australia is restricted to the Yilgarn and Pilbara Cratons of Western Australia. We interpret these new data to indicate the presence of ???3150 Ma crust at or near the surface throughout a wedge-shaped region covering an area of at least ???1500 km2. The region is characterised by high surface heat flow, and contains Paleo- and Mesoproterozoic intrusive rocks with evolved Nd isotopic compositions and high radiogenic heat production values. The newly identified Mesoarchean rocks provide an obvious source for the evolved Nd signatures, and are themselves relatively enriched in heat producing elements, particularly considering their age. We speculate that the presence of relatively radiogenic Mesoarchean crust underlies much of the area covered by the South Australian Heat Flow Anomaly. Identification of Mesoarchean crust near the eastern margin of the Gawler Craton prompts consideration of links with other Australian Cratonic elements. As far as we are aware, no direct age equivalents of these rocks have been identified elsewhere in Australia, although we note that some recent models for Australian Proterozoic geodynamic evolution may be used to predict the presence of equivalent aged crust in the North Australian Craton.

  abstract     = {Plumes of hot upwelling rock rooted in the deepmantle have been proposed as a possible origin of hotspot volcanoes, but this idea is the subject of vigorous debate1,2 . On the basis of geodynamic com- putations, plumes of purely thermal origin should comprise thin tails, only several hundred kilometres wide3 , and be difficult to detect using standard seismic tomography techniques. Here we describe the use of a whole-mantle seismic imaging technique--- combining accurate wavefield computations with information con- tained in whole seismic waveforms4 ---that reveals the presence of broad (not thin), quasi-vertical conduits beneath many prominent hotspots. These conduits extend fromthe core--mantle boundary to about 1,000 kilometres below Earth's surface, where some are deflected horizontally, as though entrained into more vigorous upper-mantle circulation. At the base of the mantle, these conduits are rooted in patches of greatly reduced shear velocity that, in the case of Hawaii, Iceland and Samoa, correspond to the locations of known large ultralow-velocity zones5--7 . This correspondence clearly establishes a continuous connection between such zones andmantle plumes. We also show that the imaged conduits are robustly broader than classical thermal plume tails, suggesting that they are long-lived8 , and may have a thermochemical origin9--11 .Their vertical orientation suggests very sluggish background circulation below depths of 1,000 kilometres. Our results should provide con- straints on studies of viscosity layering of Earth's mantle and guide further research into thermochemical convection.},

  abstract     = {We investigated the use of enhanced spectral correlation theory for modeling the crustal features of the Antarctic from regional observations of gravity and terrain. The analysis considered 1$\infty$-gridded free-air gravity anomalies and topographic rock, ice, and water components for the region south of 60$\infty$S. We modeled terrain gravity effects at 150-km altitude by Gauss-Legendre quadrature (GLQ) integration assuming densities of 2800 kg/m3 for rock, 900 kg/m3 for ice, and 1030 kg/m3 for seawater. These effects are substantial relative to the free-air anomalies and must be compensated by the effects of subsurface density variations. Significant terrain-correlated free-air anomalies were revealed by the wavenumber correlation spectrum between the free-air anomalies and the modeled terrain gravity effects, which we interpreted mostly to reflect possible isostatic imbalances of the crust. Subtracting the terrain-correlated free-air anomalies from the total free-air anomalies and topographic gravity effects yielded terrain-decorrelated free-air anomalies and the gravity effects of isostatically compensated terrain features, respectively, which are uncorrelated with each other. The compensating effects that annihilate the latter were attributed to undulations of the Moho, which we estimated by inversion using GLQ integration and a mantle-to-crust density contrast of 400 kg/m3. The inversion produced a Moho map with nearly 40 km of total relief that agrees very well with deep seismic refraction soundings. For East Antarctica, a bimodal variation in crustal thickness was found: the crustal wedge between the eastern Weddell Sea ({\&}{\#}8771; 330$\infty$E) and the eastern flank of the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains ({\&}{\#}8771; 90$\infty$E) has a mean thickness of about 37 km, whereas the mean crustal thickness is near 32 km for the northern half of the rest of East Antarctica up to the western flank of the Transantarctic Mountains ({\&}{\#}8771; 150$\infty$E). For West Antarctica and the oceanic regions, mean crustal thicknesses of about 30 km and 14 km, respectively, are inferred. The terrain-decorrelated free-air anomalies may be related to long-wavelength, large-amplitude subcrustal density variations and to much shorter-wavelength, smaller-amplitude intracrustal density variations.},

This map synthesized over 7.1 million line-kms of survey data available up through 1999 from marine, airborne and Magsat satellite observations. Since the production of the initial map, a large number of new marine and airborne surveys and improved magnetic observations from the Orsted and CHAMP satellite missions have become available. In addition, an improved core field model for the Antarctic has been developed to better isolate crustal anomalies in these data. The next generation compilation also will likely represent the magnetic survey observations of the region in terms of a high-resolution spherical cap harmonic model. In this paper, we review the progress and problems of developing an improved magnetic anomaly map to facilitate studies of the Antarctic crustal magnetic field.},

  abstract     = {Oceanic plateaus form by mantle processes distinct from those forming oceanic crust at divergent plate boundaries. Eleven drillsites into igneous basement of Kerguelen Plateau and Broken Ridge, including seven from the recent Ocean Drilling Program Leg 183 (1998-99) and four from Legs 119 and 120 (1987-88), show that the dominant rocks are basalts with geochemical characteristics distinct from those of mid-ocean ridge basalts. Moreover, the physical characteristics of the lava flows and the presence of wood fragments, charcoal, pollen, spores and seeds in the shallow water sediments overlying the igneous basement show that the growth rate of the plateau was sufficient to form subaerial landmasses. Most of the southern Kerguelen Plateau formed at {\~{}} 110 Ma, but the uppermost submarine lavas in the northern Kerguelen Plateau erupted during Cenozoic time. These results are consistent with derivation of the plateau by partial melting of the Kerguelen plume. Leg 183 provided two new major observations about the final growth stages of the Kerguelen Plateau. 1: At several locations, volcanism ended with explosive eruptions of volatilerich, felsic magmas; although the total volume of felsic volcanic rocks is poorly constrained, the explosive nature of the eruptions may have resulted in globally significant effects on climate and atmospheric chemistry during the late-stage, subaerial growth of the Kerguelen Plateau. 2: At one drillsite, clasts of garnet-biotite gneiss, a continental rock, occur in a fluvial conglomerate intercalated within basaltic flows. Previously, geochemical and geophysical evidence has been used to infer continental lithospheric components within this large igneous province. A continental geochemical signature in an oceanic setting may represent deeply recycled crust incorporated into the Kerguelen plume or continental fragments dispersed during initial formation of the Indian Ocean during breakup of Gondwana. The clasts of garnet-biotite gneiss are the first unequivocal evidence of continental crust in this oceanic plateau. We propose that during initial breakup between India and Antarctica, the spreading center jumped northwards transferring slivers of the continental Indian plate to oceanic portions of the Antarctic plate.

  abstract     = {Palynologically dated mollusc and cirriped faunas from a region extending from the North Sea through the Baltic and Karelia to the Arkhangelsk region show that the hydrography of the Baltic was very different from the Holocene. For 2-2.5 ka in the Early Eemian a seaway existed from the Barents to the North Sea through Karelia, until it was severed at the present continental watershed to the north of Lake Onega. After this the Ladoga-Onega trough remained an arm of the Baltic for several millennia. The benthic faunas are comparable to the Holocene, but their boundaries were displaced much further into the Baltic. Notable differences from the Holocene are the absence or rarity of the Macoma balthica biocoenosis, and the presence of cold Portlandia-dominated biocoenoses in Karelia. In the Belt Sea and western Baltic winter sea surface temperatures and salinity were higher than now by ca. 6??C and 15???, and the distinctly brackish top layer was missing. At the same time cold bottom water (???2.5??C) with a tendency to anoxia characterised the Karelian arm of the Baltic. Water exchange through this area was inhibited by the constriction to the north of Lake Onega, and the basin and threshold bathymetry. Water transport through the White Sea-Baltic seaway was too sparse to play an active role in the North Atlantic surface circulation or climatic change in the region. The high salinity and temperature in the Belt Sea and western Baltic persisted throughout the Eemian, and are explained by wider and deeper passage from the North Sea to Kattegat, wider straits through Denmark, higher salinity in the North Sea, higher evaporation, as well as more dispersed fresh water supply. The advection of oceanic water into the Baltic culminated in the Early Eemian, before the Carpinus zone, and probably resulted in an oceanic climate in the Baltic region, while at the same time cold winters produced cold bottom water in the Karelian arm. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Deposits from the last interglaciation (isotope substage 5e) are rare and have been found only at three localities in both West and East Greenland. Their mollusc and foraminifer faunas indicate more vigorous sea surface circulation and sea surface temperatures some degrees higher than known from the Holocene. During this warm period ice sheet growth began. In Northwest Greenland the ice sheet reached its maximum for the last ice age during the succeeding phase, provisionally correlated with isotope substage 5d. This was followed by a new warm period with increased influx of warm subarctic water, and high summer temperatures on land, provisionally correlated with isotope substage 5a. In East Greenland the observations indicate a more complex ice sheet history. The record from Greenland is very similar to that obtained in adjacent coastal areas of the high Arctic implying that the rapid shifts from warm to cold during isotope stage 5 were especially conducive to the formation of the embryonic North American and Scandinavian ice sheets at high northern latitudes, probably because the pulses of warm water were required to advect sufficient moisture into these areas to allow the growth of continental ice sheets.},

  abstract  = {The East Greenland record of glaciation and environmental change is based on a combination of onshore and offshore studies. Glaciological work on contemporary outlet glaciers provides background for interpreting the glaciation styles of the past. The Scoresby Sund fjord system, the single largest outlet of the Inland Ice in East Greenland, and the adjacent continental shelf and slope, were the main working areas. The regionality of these results was tested with onshore and offshore work on sites further to the north in the East Greenland fjord zone. The record spans the period since Isotope Stage 7 (ca 240 ka). The most extensive glaciation phases were the Lollandselv and Scoresby Sund glaciations (Isotope Stages 7 and 6). The Langelandselv interglaciation (Isotope Substage 5e) comprises shallow marine sediments at more than 20 sites onshore, and Cibicides wuellerstorfii carrying sediments on the continental slope. Summer temperatures were 2-3??warmer than the Holocene optimum, and there was vigorous advection of warm Atlantic water into the Fjords. The warm period seems to be accompanied by a eustatic sea-level rise of ca 20 m. During the Weichselian there were three major glacier advances, the Aucellaelv, Jyllandselv, and Flakkerhuk stades (Isotope Substages 5d, ?5b, and Stages 3-2). All three advances mark a shift from one topographically determined stable position to another. In each phase the glaciers occupied almost the same space in the fjord basins and had their fronts on the inner shelf. But the glacial regime and duration was different. The Aucellaelv stade lasted ca 10 ka, and the regime resembled that of present day outlet glaciers 600 km further to the north. The Flakkerhuk stade lasted for ca 50 ka, but left only thin and sporadic till, as well as glaciolacustrine sediments in ice-dammed river valleys. The regime was polar, similar to present day glaciers in Antarctica. Its culmination, the last glacial maximum, in the period between 22 and 14 ka, is shown by a maximum in IRD deposition on the continental slope. After 12 ka, and before 10 ka, the outer fjord basins in the southern fjord zone had been abandoned by the glaciers, and at ca 9.5 ka the last resurgence, the Milne Land stade, had ended.},

  abstract     = {New multibeam bathymetric data from the southeastern Weddell Sea show significant differences in surface morphology of the outer continental shelf and slope between two adjacent cross-shelf troughs. These are the Filchner Trough and a smaller trough to the east which we refer to as the 'Halley Trough'. Multibeam bathymetric data, acoustic sub-bottom profiler and seismic data show major differences in the incidence and morphologies of submarine gullies, channel systems, submarine slides and iceberg scours, and in sediment deposition. These large-scale differences suggest significant variation in slope and sedimentary processes and in the environmental setting between the two troughs, leading to much greater deposition at the mouth of the Filchner Trough. Bedforms, including a terminal moraine and scalloped embayments on the outer shelf of the Halley Trough, provide insight into the relative timing and extent of past ice-sheet grounding and point to grounded ice near to the shelf edge during the Late Quaternary.The new data reveal two large-scale submarine slides on the upper slope of the eastern Crary Fan, a trough mouth fan offshore from the Filchner Trough. Both slides head at the shelf edge ({\~{}}. 500. m water depth), with the largest slide measuring 20. km wide and with an incision depth of 60. m. Multibeam and seismic data show elongate slabs on the seafloor surface of the mid-slope. The lack of a discernible sedimentary cover suggests that they were generated after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). This is unusual because post-LGM submarine slides are very rare on the Antarctic continental margin, and to our knowledge, no other post-LGM slides have been documented on an Antarctic trough mouth fan. Because the slides occur on a part of the continental slope where the deposition of glacial debris was greatest, we speculate that weaker, unconsolidated sedimentary layers within the subsurface are important for slide initiation here. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes the deformation that occurred in the Paleoproterozoic terrains of the Terre Ad??lie Craton (East Antartica) at ca. 1.69 Ga. The structural pattern is marked by sub-vertical deformation zones, trending N340-360??, that rework sub-horizontal fabrics. Both types of structures developed under similar partial melting conditions (thermal and pressure peaks around 700-750 ??C and 500-600 MPa, respectively) and are in part coeval. Vertical zones show kinematic indicators of dextral transpression. Strike-slip components appear to increase in intensity from W to E, toward the contact between Paleoproterozoic terrains and Archaean blocks located to the East. Flat-lying foliations bear stretching lineations, which strike N340-360??, at low-angle to the transpressional shear zones and to the boundaries between major units. Structural and metamorphic signatures are consistent with a model in which hot and weak continental domains converge toward a stiffer craton. Horizontal shortening was accommodated along vertical transpressional zones. Thickening combined with significant magmatic input might have triggered gravity-driven horizontal crustal flow at high angle to the convergence direction. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {Analysis of dredged samples from the Gulden Draak Knoll demonstrates that it is a submarine rifted continental fragment that lies at the boundary between the western Perth Abyssal Plain and Wharton Basin, Indian Ocean. The Knoll comprises a granulite facies basement, including pelitic paragneiss and mafic orthogneiss, with a Cambrian granite inferred to intrude the other rocks. Boulders and cobbles of felsic gneiss with Mesoproterozoic and Cambrian protolith ages were also sampled likely reflecting a complex basement to variable sedimentary and volcanic rocks. The U-Pb isotopic system in the Archean and Mesoproterozoic zircon is significantly disturbed, reflecting Cambrian orogenesis that affected all samples. The protolith to garnet-sillimanite-biotite paragneiss has a maximum deposition age of 1163??24Ma and includes older detrital zircon grains with populations at c. 2.65Ga and between 1.4 and 1.1Ga. A younger population in this sample is interpreted as a mix of newly grown metamorphic zircon and isotopically reset zircon, implying that the granulite facies metamorphism occurred at c. 511??5Ma. Protracted Cambrian orogenesis is indicated by a metamorphic age in the mafic orthogneiss of 530??6Ma and isotopic disturbance shortly following emplacement of granite (c. 540Ma with zircon ages disturbed to 509??7Ma) and the protolith to the felsic orthogneiss (c. 528Ma with zircon ages disturbed to 510??3Ma). Xenocrystic zircon grains in the Cambrian rocks include Archean (c. 2839??9Ma) and Mesoproterozoic (1230-1370Ma) populations also isotopically disturbed during Cambrian orogenesis. Igneous Cambrian zircon grains have less radiogenic Hf-isotope compositions (Hf{\textless}inf{\textgreater}i{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}=0.281821-0.281367) than Mesoproterozoic xenocrysts (Hf{\textless}inf{\textgreater}i{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}=0.282267-0.281993), indicating limited involvement of the Mesoproterozoic crust in granite production. A more likely source includes Archean crust represented by xenocrysts with Hf{\textless}inf{\textgreater}i{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}=0.281399-0.280863. The Gulden Draak Knoll is reconstructed in Gondwana ('Leeuwin' full-fit model) along strike of a major structure termed the Indo-Australo-Antarctic Suture (IAAS), recently mapped from geophysical interpretations in Wilkes Land, Antarctica. New isotopic data suggest that basement rocks from the Gulden Draak Knoll have affinity to crust exposed either side of the IAAS. Determining if this structure is a suture zone sensu stricto remains to be tested.},

  abstract     = {The lithosphere is the earth's strong outer layer that remains a coherent unit for long times during plate motions. The motions lead to shearing of its hot and ductile lower part. The base of the lithosphere is placed where the shearing is large enough to effectively decouple the coherent plates from the underlying mantle. Here the depth and temperature where this occurs under stable continental areas were modeled by using the experimentally determined creep properties of olivine (which depend on temperature, pressure and fluid content) for different geotherms and different magnitudes of the basal drag. It is found that the shearing increases rapidly downward in a ca. 20-25{~}km thick decoupling zone where the bottom of the lithospherecan can be placed. This zone is deeper for cooler geotherms and for smaller a basal drag, while the presence of fluids makes it shallower. In dry rock this zone is at the mantle adiabat or cooler when the basal drag is {\textgreater} 0.5{~}MPa. Under Archean cratons whose temperature is represented by xenolith geotherms the decoupling zone is 180-240{~}km deep. Higher crustal heat generation than in cratons (common in post-Archean terranes) by itself causes the decoupling zone to be a few tens of kilometers shallower, and it will be even shallower if the mantle heat flow is larger than under cratons. The base of the lithosphere need not follow an isotherm. As the lithospheric thickness depends on several factors it will change when any of these changes, which is expected to have happened many times in earth history. To persist the lithosphere should escape being sheared off laterally, regardless of its buoyancy. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {We have compiled a large number of seismic records and descriptions of sediment cores obtained from the southeastern Barents Sea (Pechora Sea) by former Soviet Union institutions. Five major seismostratigraphic units (SSU-I-V) were recognized. The oldest till (SSU-V) is mainly confined to the southernmost area and is covered by a 100-150-m-thick wedge of Middle Weichselian marine sediments (SSU-IV) distal to the mouth of the Pechora River. Three Late Weichselian ice sheet margins are identified on the Pechora Sea shelf. The oldest is named the Kolguev Line and it marks the southern limit of the youngest till sheet (SSU-III) in the Barents Sea as well as the northern, erosional limit of SSU-IV and -V. The Kolguev Line marks the maximum extension of the Barents Ice Sheet during the Late Weichselian. The Kurentsovo Line, which is located 50-100 km further to the north, is much more expressed than the Kolguev Line and corresponds with long ice-pushed bedrock ridges and till ridges. Up to 100-m-thick accumulations of glaciomarine sediments (SSU-II) were mapped on the southern side of the Kolguev Line whereas less than 10-20 m where found on the northern side of the inferred ice sheet margin, indicating that the ice front remained at this position for considerable time. The youngest line is the southern continuation of the Admiralty Banks moraines, which have previously been mapped along the western margin of Novaya Zemlya. The Kolguev and Kurentsovo lines were both formed by an ice sheet centered in the Barents Sea, whereas the Admiralty Banks moraines were deposited from an ice sheet over Novaya Zemlya during the final stage of the Late Weichselian, possibly during the Younger Dryas. Submerged shorelines of Late Weichselian/Early Holocene ages have been identified on the shelf down to a water depth of 50-70 m indicating a modest glacio-isostatic depression that partly compensated the sea-level fall during the last glacial maximum. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract     = {Multiproxy climate records from Iceland document complex changes in terrestrial climate and glacier fluctuations through the Holocene, revealing some coherent patterns of change as well as significant spatial variability. Most studies on the Last Glacial Maximum and subsequent deglaciation reveal a dynamic Iceland Ice Sheet (IIS) that responded abruptly to changes in ocean currents and sea level. The IIS broke up catastrophically around 15 ka as the Polar Front migrated northward and sea level rose. Indications of regional advance or halt of the glaciers are seen in late Aller??d/early Younger Dryas time and again in PreBoreal time. Due to the apparent rise of relative sea level in Iceland during this time, most sites contain evidence for fluctuating, tidewater glacier termini occupying paleo fjords and bays. The time between the end of the Younger Dryas and the Preboreal was characterized by repeated j??kulhlaups that eroded glacial deposits. By 10.3 ka, the main ice sheet was in rapid retreat across the highlands of Iceland. The Holocene thermal maximum (HTM) was reached after 8 ka with land temperatures estimated to be 3 ??C higher than the 1961-1990 reference, and net precipitation similar to modern. Such temperatures imply largely ice-free conditions across Iceland in the early to mid-Holocene. Several marine and lacustrine sediment climate proxies record substantial summer temperature depression between 8.5 and 8 ka, but no moraines have been detected from that time. Termination of the HTM and onset of Neoglacial cooling took place sometime after 6 ka with increased glacier activity between 4.5 and 4.0 ka, intensifying between 3.0 and 2.5 ka. Although a distinct warming during the Medieval Warm Period is not dramatically apparent in Icelandic records, the interval from ca AD 0 to 1200 is commonly characterized by relative stability with slow rates of change. The literature most commonly describes Little Ice Age moraines (ca AD 1250-1900) as representing the most extensive ice margins since early Holocene deglaciation, with temperature depressions of 1-2 ??C compared to the AD 1961-1990 average. Steep north-south and west-east temperature gradients are reconstructed in the Holocene records of Iceland, suggesting a strong maritime influence on the terrestrial climate of Iceland. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract     = {Compared to other basic mechanical properties of rocks, Poisson's ratio is an elastic constant of which the significance is generally underrated. Yet, in rock mechanics, there is a considerable number of diverse areas which require a prior knowledge or estimation of the value of Poisson's ratio. This paper examines the values and applications of Poisson's ratio in rock mechanics. Following an historical account of the initial controversy, whether it was a material constant or not, the effects of Poisson's ratio in the elastic deformation of materials, intact rocks, and rock masses are briefly reviewed. Also, the reported values of Poisson's ratio for some elements, materials, and minerals are compiled while typical ranges of values are presented for some rocks and granular soils. Finally, Poisson's ratio classifications are recommended for isotropic intact rocks. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Structures of Delamerian-Ross age were subsequently reactivated during late Mesozoic-Cenozoic Gondwana breakup, strongly influencing the geometry of continental rifting and providing clues about the origins and configuration of the pre-existing basement structures. An ocean-continent transform boundary developed off western Tasmania follows the trace of an older Paleozoic strike-slip structure (Avoca-Sorell fault system) optimally oriented for reactivation during the final separation of Australia from Antarctica. This boundary cuts across rocks preserving an earlier record of arc-continent collision during the course of which continental crust was subducted to mantle depths and Cambrian mafic-ultramafic island arc rocks were thrust westwards over late Neoproterozoic-Cambrian passive margin sequences. Collision was accompanied by development of a foreland basin into which 520-600. Ma arc-derived detrital zircons were shed. Following a reversal in subduction polarity, and change to transcurrent motion along the Gondwana margin, Tasmania migrated northward along the proto-Avoca fault system before entering a subduction zone located along the Heathcote-Governor fault system, precipitating a second collision, south-vergent thrusting, and tectonic reworking of the already accreted Cambrian arc-forearc assemblages and underlying passive margin sequences. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

Following identification of a previously unmapped crustal-scale structure in the southern part of the early Palaeozoic Delamerian Orogen (Coorong Shear Zone), a more tightly constrained plate reconstruction for these margins is proposed. This reconstruction places the Coorong Shear Zone opposite the Mertz Shear Zone in Antarctica and lends itself to a revised interpretation of continental rifting along Australia's southern margin in which rift basin architecture, margin segmentation and the formation of ocean-floor fracture zones are all linked to pre-existing basement structure and the reactivation of a few deep-rooted crustal structures inherited from the Delamerian Orogeny in particular. Reactivation of the Coorong Shear Zone and other basement structures (Avoca--Sorell Fault Zone) during the earlier stages of rifting was accompanied by the partitioning of extensional strain and formation of late Jurassic--Early Cretaceous normal faults and half-graben in the Bight and Otway basins with opposing NE--SW and NW--SE structural trends. Previously, the Mertz Shear Zone has been correlated with the Proterozoic Kalinjala Mylonite Zone in the Gawler Craton but this positions Australia 300--400 km too far east relative to Antarctica prior to breakup and fails to secure an equally satisfactory match in both basement geology and the superimposed extension-related structures.},

Stable chlorine enters the atmosphere from the oceans. Their ratio does not depend on chloride concentration in precipitations and on sublimation of snow. In situ production of 36Cl in permafrost ice via cosmic ray-induced reactions and neutron capture are calculated and the dating age limit is estimated as 3 million years. 36Cl/Cl ratios in permafrost samples from cape Svyatoy Nos (Laptev Sea coast), North-Eastern Siberia, are measured by accelerator mass spectrometry. Analysis of the first results and the calculated dates support the feasibility of the 36Cl permafrost dating method. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {The Ordovician Macquarie Arc in the eastern subprovince of the Lachlan Orogen, southeastern Australia, is an unusual arc that evolved in four vertically stacked volcanic phases over {\~{}}37millionyears, and which is flanked by coeval, craton-derived, passive margin sedimentary terranes dominated by detrital quartz grains. Although these two terranes are marked by a general absence of provenance mixing, LA-ICPMS analysis of U-Pb and Lu-Hf contents in zircon grains in volcaniclastic rocks from 3 phases of the arc demonstrates the same age populations of detrital grains inherited from the Gondwana margin as those that characterise the flanking quartz-rich Ordovician turbidites. Magmatic Phase 1 is older, {\~{}}480Ma, and is characterised by detrital zircons grains with ages of {\~{}}490-540 with negative ??Hf from 0 to mainly -7.78, 550-625Ma ages with negative ??Hf from 0 to -26.6 and 970-1250Ma (Grenvillian) with ??Hf from +6.47 to -6.44. We have not as yet identified any magmatic zircons related to Phase 1 volcanism. Small amounts of detrital zircons also occur in Phase 2 ({\~{}}468-455Ma), hiatus 1 and Phase 4 ({\~{}}449-443Ma), all of which are dominated by Ordovician magmatic zircons with positive ??Hf values, indicating derivation from unevolved mantle-derived magmas, consistent with formation in an intraoceanic island arc. Because of the previously obtained positive whole rock ??Nd values from Phase 1 lavas, we rule out contamination from substrate or subducted sediments. Instead, we suggest that during Phase 1, the Macquarie Arc lay close enough to the Gondwana margin so that volcaniclastic rocks were heavily contaminated by detrital zircon grains shed from granites and Grenvillian mafic rocks mainly from Antarctica (Ross Orogen and East Antarctica) and/or the Delamerian margin of Australia. The reduced nature of a Gondwana population in Phase 2, hiatus 1 and Phase 4 is attributed to opening of a marginal basin between the Gondwana margin and the Macquarie Arc that put it out of reach of all but rare turbiditic currents. ?? 2010.},

  abstract     = {The margins of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet (FIS) during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) are fairly well constrained, yet the thickness of the FIS and its temporal evolution are poorly known. Here, we use beryllium-10 (10Be) exposure ages of glacially transported boulders along three vertical transects in southern Norway to determine past ice-sheet elevations. The ice surface elevation during the LGM at our westernmost site, Sk??la, was likely at approximately 1440 m, coinciding with a previously mapped trimline. At our central site, Bl??h??, the ice surface elevation at the LGM was at least at ???1620 m, likely closer to 1800 m. At Elg??hogna, our easternmost site, LGM ice was above the summit elevation of 1460 m. Rapid deglaciation began at Sk??la and Bl??h?? at approximately 13.5-14.510Be ka and at approximately 1210Be ka at Elg??hogna. By approximately 910Be ka, the FIS had thinned to below our lowest sample at each location. Periods of rapid thinning correlate with an exposure dated ice-margin history, as well as the glaciation curve for western Scandinavia. Our data, when combined with previous bedrock and blockfield (highly weathered bedrock on summits) exposure ages, resolve a long-standing debate over the age and geomorphic interpretation of blockfields and weathering zones in southern Norway. Frozen-bed, low-erosive ice clearly covered the summit blockfields at Bl??h??, and especially at Elg??hogna, where we find a large and progressive divergence between boulder and bedrock exposure ages with elevation. We conclude that the lower limit of blockfields in these areas should be interpreted as an englacial thermal boundary, rather than the upper limit of the LGM FIS, and that blockfields have survived multiple glacial cycles. We also compare our deglaciation record with several models of the FIS. Models that predict how the FIS changed during deglaciation, either through inversion of crustal rebound or through climate-dependent forward modeling, generally match our exposure ages reasonably well during deglaciation, but predict larger LGM surface elevations than our data indicate. On the other hand, the CLIMAP maximum model, which provides LGM elevations only, agrees with our results fairly well. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the model sensitivity of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) to anomalous freshwater flux in the tropical and northern Atlantic. Forcing in both locations leads to the same qualitative response: a positive freshwater anomaly induces a weakening of the AMOC and a negative freshwater anomaly strengthens the AMOC. Strong differences arise in the temporal characteristics and amplitude of the response. The advection of the tropical anomaly up to the deep water formation area leads to a time delayed response compared to a northern forcing. Thus, in its transient response, the AMOC is less sensitive to a constant anomalous freshwater flux in the tropics than in the north. This difference decreases with time and practically vanishes in equilibrium with constant freshwater forcing. The equilibrium response of the AMOC shows a non-linear dependence on freshwater forcing in both locations, with a stronger sensitivity to positive freshwater forcing. As a consequence, competitive forcing in both regions is balanced when the negative forcing is about 1.5 times larger than the positive forcing. The relaxation time of the AMOC after termination of a freshwater perturbation depends significantly on the AMOC strength itself. A strong overturning exhibits a faster relaxation to its unperturbed state. By means of a set of complementary experiments (pulse-perturbations, constant and stochastic forcing) we quantify these effects and discuss the corresponding time scales and physical processes.},

  abstract     = {The nature of the full-glacial vegetation of Beringia has been the subject of a great deal of investigation and debate. Here we present a reconstruction of an intact example of the full-glacial upland vegetation of part of the northern Seward Peninsula at one point in time. The area was blanketed by more than 1m of tephra ca. 18,000 14C BP (ca. 21,500 cal. BP), and the former land-surface was preserved in the permafrost. The discovery of the land-surface provides a unique opportunity to study a fossil ecosystem preserved in situ. Macrofossils were used to reconstruct the vegetation growing at several sites on the buried land-surface. The macrofossil assemblages indicate a vegetation characterized by graminoids and forbs, with the occasional occurrence of Salix arctica. The vegetation was dominated by Kobresia myosuroides, other sedges (Carex), and grasses, with a fine-scale mosaic related to snow accumulation and moisture availability. Overall, the vegetation was a closed, dry, herb-rich tundra-grassland with a continuous moss layer, growing on calcareous soil that was continuously supplied with loess. Nutrient renewal by loess deposition was probably responsible for the relatively fertile vegetation, and the occurrence of a continuous mat of acrocarpous mosses. Good physiognomic analogues can be suggested, but no exact modern vegetational analogues have been found, probably because the full-glacial environment and climate with loess deposition do not occur today. ?? 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

More than 1.5. million line-km of new air- and shipborne data have been acquired over the past decade by the international community in Antarctica. These new data together with surveys that previously were not in the public domain significantly upgrade the ADMAP compilation. Aeromagnetic flights over East Antarctica have been concentrated in the Transantarctic Mountains, the Prince Charles Mountains - Lambert Glacier area, and western Dronning Maud Land (DML) - Coats Land. Additionally, surveys were conducted over Lake Vostok and the western part of Marie Byrd Land by the US Support Office for Aerogeophysical Research projects and over the Amundsen Sea Embayment during the austral summer of 2004/2005 by a collaborative US/UK aerogeophysical campaign. New aeromagnetic data over the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains (120,000. line-km), acquired within the IPY Antarctica's Gamburtsev Province project reveal fundamental geologic features beneath the East Antarctic Ice sheet critical to understanding Precambrian continental growth processes. Roughly 100,000. line-km of magnetic data obtained within the International Collaboration for Exploration of the Cryosphere through Aerogeophysical Profiling promises to shed light on subglacial lithology and identify crustal boundaries for the central Antarctic Plate. Since the 1996/97 season, the Alfred Wegener Institute has collected 90,000. km of aeromagnetic data along a 1200. km long segment of the East Antarctic coast over western DML. Recent cruises by Australian, German, Japanese, Russian, British, and American researchers have contributed to long-standing studies of the Antarctic continental margin. Along the continental margin of East Antarctica west of Maud Rise to the George V Coast of Victoria Land, the Russian Polar Marine Geological Research Expedition and Geoscience Australia obtained 80,000 and 20,000. line-km, respectively, of integrated seismic, gravity and magnetic data. Additionally, US expeditions collected 128,000. line-km of shipborne magnetic data in the Ross Sea sector. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The more than 350,000 line-km of new airborne and marine magnetic observations for the East Antarctic continental margin have been compiled into an improved definition of crustal magnetic anomaly patterns. This compilation provides important new constraints on the breakup processes and igneous activity related to the formation of the passive margin of East Antarctica. The eastern sector of the map from Bruce Rise in the west to the D'Urville Sea in the east is largely dominated by seafloor spreading magnetic anomalies. The 'Ad??lie Rift Block' of highly stretched and extensively faulted continental crust is associated with a smooth anomaly fabric. Abrupt magnetic anomaly changes along the oceanic-continent transition in the Cooperation Sea including the Enderby Basin Anomaly extend for more than 1680. km from the Kerguelen Plateau towards the Cosmonaut Sea. Three sectors of the East Antarctic continental margin exhibit pronounced disparities in the anomaly patterns that strongly suggest different modes of seafloor formation. Strong positive seafloor magnetic anomalies mark the southern margin of the Kerguelen Plateau, the Maud Rise and adjacent areas in the Riiser-Larsen Sea. The new compilation suggests that at least 300. km of the Enderby Basin and Shackleton Basin may be part of the Cretaceous Kerguelen Volcanic Province and possibly maps an abandoned 'fossil' spreading center in the central Enderby Basin. The majority of the published age models for the Enderby Basin and "Australian sector" of the East Antarctic margin are not in agreement with the structural grain of magnetic anomalies in the newly compiled map. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Sea-level fall near the grounding line of a retreating marine ice sheet has a stabilizing influence on the ice sheets, and previous studies have established the importance of this feedback on ice age AIS evolution. Here we use a coupled ice sheet--sea-level model to investigate the impact of the feedback mechanism on future AIS retreat over centennial and millennial timescales for a range of emission scenarios. We show that the combination of bedrock uplift and sea-surface drop associated with ice-sheet retreat significantly reduces AIS mass loss relative to a simulation without these effects included. Sensitivity analyses show that the stabilization tends to be greatest for lower emission scenarios and Earth models characterized by a thin elastic lithosphere and low-viscosity upper mantle, as is the case for West Antarctica.},

  abstract     = {The Pacific margin of East Antarctica records a long tectonic history of crustal growth and breakup, culminating in the early Paleozoic Ross Orogeny associated with Gondwanaland amalgamation. Periods of older tectonism have been proposed (e.g. Precambrian Nimrod and Beardmore Orogenies), but the veracity of these events is difficult to document because of poor petrologic preservation, geochronologic uncertainty due to isotopic resetting, and debated geological field relationships. Of these, the Nimrod Orogeny was originally proposed as a period of Neoproterozoic metamorphism and deformation within crystalline basement rocks of the Nimrod Group, based on ???1000 Ma K-Ar mineral ages. Later structural and thermochronologic study attributed major deformation features in the Nimrod Group to Ross-age basement reactivation. Yet, new SHRIMP ion microprobe U-Pb zircon age data for gneissic and metaigneous rocks of the Nimrod Group indicate a period of deep-crustal metamorphism and magmatism between ???1730-1720 Ma. Igneous zircons from gneissic Archean protoliths show metamorphic overgrowths of ???1730-1720 Ma, and an eclogitic block preserved within the gneisses contains zircons yielding an average metamorphic crystallization age of ???1720 Ma. Deformed granodiorite that intrudes the gneisses and associated metasedimentary rocks yields a concordant zircon crystallization age of ???1730 Ma. Despite scant petrologic evidence for these metamorphic and igneous events, the zircon ages from these diverse rock types indicate major crustal thickening, possibly due to collision, in the late Paleoproterozoic. We therefore recommend revival of the term Nimrod Orogeny to describe Paleoproterozoic tectonic events in rocks of the East Antarctic shield. Similarities in the ages of igneous and metamorphic events in the Nimrod Group and geologic units elsewhere in present-day East Antarctica, southern Australia and southwestern North America suggest they may have played a role in early supercontinent assembly. In particular, similarity with the Laurentian Mojave province is consistent with Proterozoic plate reconstructions joining ancestral East Antarctica with western Laurentia. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

We divide rocks previously mapped as the Beardmore Group into (1) an inboard late Neoproterozoic assemblage (probably less than or equal to670 Ma) and (2) a volumetrically dominant, outboard assemblage that is latest Early Cambrian or younger (less than or equal to520 Ma). The inboard assemblage contains mature, multicycle sediment derived from mixed cratonic sources dominated by 2.8- and 1.9-1.4-Ga components. It was deposited in a platformal-to-shoreline setting along an existing rifted margin. A new zircon age of 668 +/- 1 Ma for mafic igneous rocks within this assemblage is younger than previously reported, indicating deposition in the late Neoproterozoic and raising questions as to the age of rifting. The outboard assemblage contains first-cycle sediment with dramatically different provenance, including fresh, young (580-520 Ma), locally derived igneous material and contributions from similar to1400-, 1100-940-, and similar to825-Ma sources. The youngest zircon ages (525-522 Ma) are consistent with newly discovered Cambrian-aspect trace fossils. Therefore, these outboard rocks are best considered as siliciclastic units of the upper Byrd Group. The detrital age patterns suggest a change from passive-margin sedimentation derived from the adjacent craton to a younger succession receiving detritus from an active-margin igneous source. Unique similar to1.4-Ga age components, unknown in Antarctic and Australian cratons, coupled with eastward paleocurrents in the outboard assemblage, indicate that the similar to1.4-Ga Laurentian anorogenic igneous province may extend beneath the polar ice cap in Antarctica. Together, the new age data support a Rodinia fit between Antarctica and Laurentia and suggest that sedimentation across the rifted margin was substantially younger than previously inferred.},

The capability to routinely measure low concentrations of stable and radioactive cosmogenic nuclides has led to new methods for addressing long-standing geologic questions and has provided insights into rates and styles of sur"cial processes. The di!erent physical and chemical properties of the six most widely used nuclides: 3He, 10Be, 14C, 21Ne, 26Al, and 36Cl, make it possible to apply the surface exposure dating methods on rock surfaces of virtually any lithology at any latitude and altitude, for exposures ranging from 10{\^{}}2 to 10{\^{}}7 years. The terrestrial in situ cosmogenic nuclide method is beginning to revolutionize the manner in which we study landscape evolution. Single or multiple nuclides can be measured in a single rock surface to obtain erosion rates on boulder and bedrock surfaces, fluvial incision rates, denudation rates of individual landforms or entire drainage basins, burial histories of rock surfaces and sediment, scarp retreat, fault slip rates, paleoseismology, and paleoaltimetry. Ages of climatic variations recorded by moraine and alluvium sediments are being directly determined. Advances in our understanding of how cosmic radiation interacts with the geomagnetic field and atmosphere will improve numerical simulations of cosmic-ray interactions over any exposure duration and complement additional empirical measurements of nuclide production rates. The total uncertainty in the exposure ages is continually improving. This article presents the theory necessary for interpreting cosmogenic nuclide data, reviews estimates of parameters, describes strategies and practical considerations in "eld applications, and assesses sources of error in interpreting cosmogenic nuclide measurements.},

The 8.2 ky isotopic event on both sides of the North Atlantic ocean is interpreted as a cold period, most probably induced by a perturba- tion of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation.

  abstract     = {Three episodes of deformation spanning a period of ???900 Ma are recognised. The first deformation at ??? 1000 Ma involved progressive, yet distinct stages within a protracted, composite event involving recumbent folding, low-angle thrust faulting and locally, highly oblique, transpressive strike-slip shearing. These structures suggest tectonic transport from the south and southeast during D1. D2 at ???500 Ma is variable in the different areas and involved thrust faults and folding with locally developed axial-planar foliations. The orientations of the fault planes and axial-planar structures suggest transport from the west and northwest in western Sverdrupfjella and from the southeast in Kirwanveggen. D3 involved normal faulting and jointing, adjacent and parallel to the Jutulstraumen Glacier in the west. The joints affect the alkaline complexes, some of which are Jurassic in age and consequently D3 is related to the breakup of Gondwana. Four phases of metamorphism, related to the deformation, are recognised. The dominant mineral assemblages M1-3 are typical of medium- to high-grade metamorphism. Discordant mafic intrusions provide evidence of a long history of metamorphism. Mafic nodules from the eastern part of the area contain high-pressure assemblages representing M1. Assemblages and textures indicate that M2 was related to isothermal decompression related to the uplift caused by thrust faulting during D1. The period between M2 and M3 appears to have involved annealing at mid-crustal levels. M3 mineral development is dominated by biotite which is oriented axial-planar to D2 folds. M4 assemblages are typically low-grade and involve hydrothermal alteration resulting in chloritisation and sausseritisation related to D3. ?? 1995.},

  abstract     = {Two geological provinces of western Dronning Maud Land provide constraints which allow preliminary modelling of crustal evolution in this part of East Antarctica. The Grunehogna province comprises a 3000 Ma granitic basement overlain by a 1000 Ma sequence of sedimentary and volcanic rocks which accumulated in a foreland basin. Juxtaposed with this cratonic province is the Mesoproterozoic Maud orogenic belt. The H.U. Sverdrupfjella portion of this belt consists of two lithostratigraphic assemblages: (i) adjacent to the suture are amphibolite facies calc-alkaline metavolcanic rocks suggesting a volcanic arc environment; (ii) further to the east and southeast are granulite facies para- and ortho-gneisses compatible with a retro-arc marginal basin heritage. Both assemblages were intruded by Proterozoic and lower Phanerozoic granitoids and provide evidence of two distinct major events in the orogenic history. In the eastern assemblage, the first event (1200-900 Ma) involved metamorphism with initial high pressures (12-15 kbar, 750??C) followed by decompression and thermal relaxation (8 kbar, 850??C), a path attributed to continental collision with deep burial of a marginal basin characterised by an elevated geotherm. The second event ( ??? 500 Ma), also under medium- to high-grade metamorphic conditions ( ??? 600??C, 5-6 kbar), caused tectonic inversion of the metamorphic profile by thrusting followed by rapid uplift and exhumation. Tectonothermal overprinting of the Maud Belt and folding of the 1000 Ma supracrustal sequence near boundaries between the cratonic and orogenic terrains suggest that a Cambrian-Ordovician suture is close to (within?) the 1000 Ma belt. Geological correlation of the two Antarctic provinces with those in southeastern Africa identifies this area as a portion of the Kalahari Craton detached during Gondwana break-up. Similar overprinting of the Proterozoic belts in Africa, such as the Mozambique belt, suggests that these zones of crustal disequilibrium were the loci of repeated continental break-up and convergence. ?? 1995.},

It is likely related to the fast thermal reaction of the subsurface of steep rock slopes and a corresponding destabilization of ice-filled discontinuities. This suggests that rockfall may be a direct and unexpectedly fast impact of climate change. Based upon our measurements in Alpine rock faces, we present model simulations illustrating the distribution and degradation of permafrost where the summer of 2003 has resulted in extreme thaw. We argue that hotter summers predicted by climate models for the coming decades will result in reduced stability of many alpine rock walls.},

  abstract     = {Marine sediments from river sections in the Mezen River drainage, northwest Russia, have been analysed for dinoflagellate cysts, foraminifers and molluscs. The sediments were dated by pollen analysis and by reference to the local sea-level history, and are Late Saalian to late Eemian (c. 133 to 119.5 kyr in age). The Late Saalian deglaciation was characterized by Arctic conditions, but a few centuries into the Eemian the Gulf Stream system carried warm Atlantic water into the region. At 129.8 kyr BP there was a marked increase in the influx of Atlantic water, and the advection of warm Atlantic water was stronger and probably penetrated further eastwards than at present. The molluscs, dinoflagellate cysts and foraminifers reflect conditions warmer than present and that the optimum temperature occurred at the time of the early Eemian global sea-level rise. Around 128 kyr BP, the eustatic sea-level rise was curbed by isostatic rebound and accompanying regression and constriction of marine passages to the White Sea. Local, low-saline, stratified basins developed and characterized the next five to six millennia.},

The early Wisconsinan and pre-Wisconsinan glaciations are represented by broad lobate moraines extending as much as 30 km north of the Koryak Mountains. Field evidence demonstrates that the terminal, lateral, and medial moraines, as well as meltwater channels, dead ice topography, kettles, and other ash plains mark the extent of ice during the last glacial maximum (LGM), during which glaciers reached no more than 20 km beyond their present limits. Those emanating from the southern Koryak Mountains may have reached the Bering Sea, Numerical and relative dating techniques support these results and test the theoretical models of the LGM in western Beringia, Erratics on moraines and glaciofluvial terraces, common to all valleys at 13-13.8 m above river level, yield (CI)-C-36 exposure ages ranging from 10.08 to 25.78 ka, The Koryak Mountains-Lake Mainitz record of glaciation is spatially and temporally consistent with the glaciation pattern across central Beringia found in other terrestrial and marine records, Glacier growth in the Koryak Mountains was sustained by possible increased summer sea surface temperatures and precipitation in the northwest Pacific region, Evidence from the northern Koryak Mountains (lat 64 degrees"N, long 177 degrees E) indicates that the extent of ice in western Beringia was limited to mountain and valley glaciers during the LGM. This field-based research contradicts M.G. Grosswald's theoretical Beringian ice sheet hypothesis.},

  abstract     = {A multi-core, multidisciplinary palaeolimnological study of the partially varved sediment of a deep, meromictic, arctic lake, Kongressvatnet (Svalbard, Western Spitsbergen), provides a record of environmental and climatic changes during last ca. 1800 years. The chronology of sedimentation was established using several dating techniques (137Cs, 210Pb, varve counts, palaeomagnetic correlation). A multiproxy record of palaeolimnological variability was compiled based on sedimentation rates, magnetic properties, varve thickness, organic matter, geochemistry, pigments from algal and photosynthetic bacteria, mineralogy and biological assemblages (diatoms, Cladocera). The major features recognised in our master core K99-3 include a shift in sediment source and supply (magnetic measurements, geochemistry) probably caused by glaciological changes in the catchment around 38-32 cm core depth (AD 700-820). Additional environmental changes are inferred at 20-18, 8-4.5 and 3-2 cm (AD ca. 1160-1255; 1715-1880; 1940-1963, respectively). During the past ca. 120 years a prominent sedimentological change from brownish-grey, partly laminated silt-clay (varves) to black organic-rich deposits was observed. From AD 1350 to AD1880 the sediment is comprised of a continuous sequence of varves, whereas the earlier sediments are mostly homogeneous with only a few short intercalated laminated sections between AD 860 and 1350. Sedimentation and accumulation rates increased during the last 30 years (modern warming). Pigment concentrations are very low in the lower ca. 32 cm of the core (AD 820) probably because of the high turbidity high energy environment. The high sulphur content in the uppermost 32 cm of sediment has given rise to two horizontally stratified populations of sulphur anaerobic photosynthetic bacteria, as inferred from their specific carotenoids. These bacteria populations are much more abundant during the Little Ice Age (LIA) than during warmer periods (e.g., during the Medieval Warm Period and 20\textsuperscript{th} century). Diatoms are lacking from the core base up to 18 cm (ca. AD 1255); at this level, species indicative of mesotrophic water are present, whereas from 17 cm to the top of the core, oligotrophic taxa such as Staurosira construens/S. pinnata complex dominate, indicating extended ice coverage and more oligotrophic waters during the LIA. The concentration of Cladocera subfossil remains (dominated by Chydorus) are relatively high in the deepest sections (54-32 cm), whereas the upper 32 cm are characterized by a very low concentration of remains, possibly because of the strongly anoxic conditions, and in this upper sediment section rotifer resting eggs become prevalent. We interpret these changes as responses to climate forcing through its impact on glacial melt water, lake ice cover duration and mainly redox conditions in deep water. The observed changes suggest that at least some of our recorded changes may parallel the Greenland Ice core, although our study added more details about the inferred climatic changes. Further aspects are discussed, such as catchment processes, glacial activity, duration of the Medieval Warm Period, the Little Ice Age, local human activity, and limnology.},

  abstract     = {Ideas about the character and evolution of englacial drainage systems have been deeply influenced by the theoretical model developed by Shreve [1972. Movement of water in glaciers. Journal of Glaciology 11(62), 205-214]. The Shreve model is based on three main assumptions: (1) englacial drainage is in steady state; (2) englacial water will flow along the steepest hydraulic gradient within the glacier; and (3) pressure head equals the pressure of the surrounding ice minus a small component due to melting of the walls. The Shreve model has been widely adopted as a fundamental component of englacial drainage theory. There is no evidence, however, that the model provides a realistic picture of actual glacial drainage systems. To evaluate Shreve's theory, we used speleological techniques to directly survey englacial conduits. We mapped a total of 8.25 km of passage in 27 distinct englacial conduits in temperate, polythermal, cold-based and debris-covered glaciers between 2005 and 2008. New information reported here is supplemented by published data on 40 other englacial conduits located worldwide and surveyed to ice depths of 176 m using speleological techniques. In all cases, englacial drainage systems consisted of a single unbranching conduit. Englacial conduit morphologies were found to be intimately linked to the orientation of a glacier's principal stresses or the presence of pre-existing lines of high hydraulic conductivity. If a sufficient supply of water is available, hydrofracturing forms vertical conduits in zones of longitudinal extension and subhorizontal conduits where longitudinal stresses are compressive. On unfractured glacier surfaces, relatively shallow subhorizontal conduits with migrating nickpoints form by cut-and-closure provided channel incision is significantly faster than surface lowering. Conduits can also form along permeable debris-filled crevasse traces that connect supraglacial lake basins of different potential. Our results suggest that Shreve-type englacial drainage systems do not exist and implies that englacial conduits can only penetrate through thick ice to recharge the bed where supraglacial water bodies either intersect, or are advected through, zones of acceleration. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract      = {For decades there has been a vigorous debate about the depth extent of continental roots. The analysis of heat-flow, mantle-xenolith and electrical-conductivity data all indicate that the coherent, conductive part of continental roots (the 'tectosphere') is at most 200-250 km thick. Some global seismic tomographic models agree with this estimate, but others suggest that a much thicker zone of high velocities lies beneath continental shields, reaching a depth of at least 400 km. Here we show that this disagreement can be reconciled by taking into account seismic anisotropy. We show that significant radial anisotropy, with horizontally polarized shear waves travelling faster than those that are vertically polarized, is present under most cratons in the depth range 250-400 km--similar to that found under ocean basins at shallower depths of 80-250 km. We propose that, in both cases, the anisotropy is related to shear in a low-viscosity asthenospheric channel, located at different depths under continents and oceans. The seismically defined 'tectosphere' is then at most 200-250 km thick under old continents. The 'Lehmann discontinuity', observed mostly under continents at about 200-250 km, and the 'Gutenberg discontinuity', observed under oceans at depths of about 60-80 km, may both be associated with the bottom of the lithosphere, marking a transition to flow-induced asthenospheric anisotropy.},

Sweet chestnut trees play a key role in Mediterranean woodlands, and for longer than two millennia have been used as a food source.

Core MD99-2304 is located on the upper continental margin, reflecting variations in the influx of Atlantic Water in the West Spitsbergen Current. Core MD99-2305 is located in Van Mijenfjord, picturing variations in tidewater glacier activity as well as fjord-ocean circulation changes. Surface water warmer than today, was present on the margin as soon as the Van Mijenfjord was deglaciated by 11,200 cal. years BP. Relatively warm water invaded the fjord bottom almost immediately after the deglaciation. A relatively warm early Holocene was followed by an abrupt cooling at 8800 cal. years BP on the continental margin. Another cooling in the fjord record, 8000-4000 cal. years BP, is documented by an increase in ice rafted debris and an increase in benthic foraminiferal ?? 18O. The IRD-record indicates that central Spitsbergen never was completely deglaciated during the Holocene. Relatively cool and stable conditions similar to the present were established about 4000 cal. years BP. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {Detailed stratigraphic investigations of a high-resolution sediment core from the Arctic fjord, Van Mijenfjorden, Svalbard, reveal significant reductions in benthic foraminiferal delta O-18 of 0.4{\%} and 0.2-0.3{\%} dated to c. 8200 and 8450 cal. yr BP, respectively. These reductions, combined with changes in the benthic foraminiferal fauna and IRD, indicate substantial changes in the hydrography of the fjord, such as freshening of the bottom water, enhanced sea ice distribution and reduced biogenic production. The age and duration (similar to 100 years) of the youngest event is directly in phase with the 8200 cal. yr anomaly in the delta O-18 record GISP2 and NGRIP of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The changes around 8450 cal. yr BP compare well to the timing of the initial freshwater drainage of the proglacial Lake Agassiz. Therefore the proxy record of Van Mijenfjorden lends support to the theory, explaining the 8200 cal. yr BP event as a cumulative response to a freshwater-forced reduction in the meridional overturning circulation in the North Atlantic. A reduction in the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) may have changed the oceanic inflow to the fjord towards reduced influence of Atlantic Water and increased the dominance of fresher Arctic Water.},

The explosion data from the Nevada Test Site, GNOME and Early Rise are all consistent with Lehmann's suggestion that there is a discontinuity at a depth of about 200 km. Comparison of the observed data between 15-degrees and 23-degrees with model calculations shows that the major differences between the western and central-eastern United States upper mantles occur above 200 km. It appears that the only reasonable explanation for the 200 km discontinuity is that it represents the termination of a zone of partial melting.},

Our records are interpreted to reflect changes in continental erosion and oceanic circulation, driven predominantly by tectonic forcing on million-year timescales in the older (pre-2 Ma) part of the record and by climatic forcing of weathering and erosion of the Eurasian continental margin on thousand-year timescales in the younger (post-2 Ma) part. These data, covering the past {\&}{\#}8764;15 Ma, show that continental inputs to the central Arctic Ocean have been more closely linked to glacial and hydrological processes occurring on the Eurasian margin than on continental North America and Greenland. The constancy of the detrital input signatures supports the early existence of an Arctic sea ice cover, whereas the major initiation of Northern Hemisphere glaciation at 2.7 Ma appears to have had little impact on the weathering regime of the Eurasian continental margin.},

Thermobarometry of peak metamorphic minerals and electron microprobe chemical dating of monazite reveal that these igneous rocks were metamorphosed to {\~{}}700 {$^{\circ}$}C and {\~{}}6.5 kbar during the Cambrian Pinjarra Orogeny at ca. 515 Ma. These data con- fi rm a continental origin for a signifi cant swathe of the southern Naturaliste Plateau, and sug- gest that the protoliths may have affi nities to Mesoproterozoic crust within the Albany-Fraser- Wilkes Orogen (Australia-Antarctica).

From west to east they are: the Koldewey Platform, the Danmarkshavn Basin, the Danmarkshavn Ridge, the Thetis Basin and the Marginal High. A sixth tectonic element, the Shannon High, has been defined in the southern part of this area. The offshore areas between 7230N and 75N are dominated by Tertiary plateau basalts, which obscure the acoustic signals from the deeper sedimentary succession. Seismic data from the area north of 75N indicate the presence of a fairly complete succession of Devonian to Neogene age, exceeding the recorded interval (8 sec TWT 13 km) in thickness in the deeper parts of the Danmarkshavn Basin. The succession has been subdivided into 15 seismic mega-sequences. In absence of well control, they have been dated by comparison to the onshore successions of East Greenland and eastern North Greenland, and the offshore successions in the southern Barents Sea and on the mid-Norwegian shelf. The Upper Palaeozoic succession is broadly similar to that of the southern Barents Sea, i.e. marine-dominated, with thick Upper CarboniferousLower Permian halite deposits in the northern Danmarkshavn Basin. The Mesozoic succession seems to show greater similarities to the onshore basins of East Greenland: rifting started during the mid-Jurassic and peaked near the JurassicCretaceous boundary. The post-volcanic succession reflects deposition on a passive margin subjected to temporary uplift during the early Miocene and the latest Miocene to earliest Pliocene.},

  abstract     = {Antarctica consists of large and wholly continental east Antarctica and smaller west Antarctica which would form large and small islands, even after isostatic rebound, if its ice cap were melted. Most of east Antarctica is a Precambrian Shield, in much of which charnockites are characteristic. The high Transantarctic Mountains, along the Ross and Weddell Seas, largely follow a geosyncline of Upper Precambrian sedimentary rocks that were deformed, metamorphosed and intruded by granitic rocks during Late Cambrian or Early Ordovician time. The rocks of the orogen were peneplained, then covered by thin and mostly continental Devonian-Jurassic sediments, which were intruded by Jurassic diabase sheets and overlain by plateau-forming tholeiites. Late Cenozoic doming and block-faulting have raised the present high mountains. Northeastern Victoria Land, the end of the Transantarctic Mountains south of New Zealand, preserves part of a Middle Paleozoic orogen. Clastic strata laid unconformably upon the Lower Paleozoic plutonic complex were metamorphosed at low grade, highly deformed and intruded by Late Devonian or Early Carboniferous granodiorites. The overlying Triassic continental sedimentary rocks have been broadly folded and normal-faulted. Interior west Antarctica is composed of miogeosynclinal clastic and subordinate carbonate rocks which span the Paleozoic Era and which were deformed, metamorphosed at generally low grade, and intruded by granitic rocks during Early Mesozoic time and possibly during other times also. Patterns of orogenic belts, if systematic, cannot yet be defined; but fragmentation and rotation of crustal blocks by oroclinal folding and strike-slip faulting can be suggested. The Ellsworth Mountains, for example, consist of Cambrian-Permian metasedimentary rocks that strike northward toward the noncorrelative and latitudinally striking Mesozoic terrane of the Antarctic Peninsula in one direction and southward toward that of the Lower Paleozoic: terrane of the Transantarctic Mountains in the other; the three regions may be separated by great strike-slip faults. The Antarctic Peninsula in west Antarctica, south of South America, consists of metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks intruded by Late Cretaceous quartz diorite. The pre-granitic rocks are of Jurassic and Early Cretaceous ages wherever they have been dated by fossils, although some crystalline complexes may be older. The S-shape of the peninsula may represent oroclinal bending within Cenozoic time as part of a motion system in which a narrow continental bridge between South America and Antarctica was deformed and ruptured. Perhaps this bridge lagged behind as the larger continental plates drifted into the Pacific Ocean Basin.},

An associated increase in the deposition of organic material resulted in hypolimnetic oxygen deficit and methane formation as inferred from elevated sulphur content of the sediments and strong depletion in C-13 of bulk organic material. In combination with dry and cold winter conditions as revealed by other proxy records, these data suggest the development of a strongly seasonal climate in northwestern Europe in response to altered atmospheric circulation at this stage. Enhanced zonal circulation with frequent cyclonic activity and increased effective humidity probably characterized the summer climate of southern and central Scandinavia, consistent with conditions inferred for continental Europe. In contrast, the winter climate was dominated by blocking high-pressure circulation, giving rise to cold and dry conditions},

The simulation uses a depth-averaged hydrodynamic code, coupled with an empirical precipitation model where surface-normal growth rate is proportional to local flow rate. The dynamics of the resulting formation, coarsening and migration (progradation) of crests is demonstrated and compared with field observations. The local self-enhancement of crests, due to increasing flow rate, in combination with lateral inhibition due to upstream drowning, implies a classical pattern formation system with a characteristic dam size, however this wavelength is not stable but increasing. The model also reproduces crest lobes, step bunching and other processes that contribute to the complex dynamics of travertine systems. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Downstream gradients in water chemistry, isotopic composition and carbonate precipitation rates have been documented for the Troll spring and travertine terrace system. The main controls on the downstream evolution of these parameters are carbon dioxide degassing, calcite precipitation, evaporation and biological activity. The carbonate precipitation rates not only show an approximately parabolic dependence on the calcite supersaturation levels, but depend also on local hydrodynamics. Downstream loss of light isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen can be explained as an effect of evaporation, as estimated using chloride as a conservative marker. Biological activity affects nitrate and bromide concentrations and influences the morphology of calcite precipitates. {\textcopyright} 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  year      = {2001},
  abstract  = {The landscapes of western Jameson Land bordering Hall Bredning fjord comprise upper river basins, glacial landscapes, lower river basins and a near-shore zone. The upper river basins are incised into bedrock and display no cover of young sediments whilst the glacial landscapes, located closer to the coast, are dominated by Pleistocene deposits and an irregular topography with hills and ridges. The lower river basins, dissecting the glacial landscapes,arc connected to the upper river basins and contain well-defined Holocene delta terraces. The near-shore zone, which includes the present coast, displays a few raised shorelines. Geomorphological observations combined with stratigraphic work and C-14 dates provide a chronological framework for the development of landscape and shoreline, as presented by a four-stage reconstruction. The first stage covers the deglaciation of western Jameson Land at the Weichselian-Holocene transition after a collapse of the main fjord glacier in Hall Bredning. The sea inundated the low-lying areas on Jameson Land forming small side-entry fjord basins that possibly follow the track of older valleys. This was followed by a second stage, the paraglacial period, when large meltwater production and sediment transport resulted in a fast infilling of the side-entry fjord basins by deltas. These are now exposed in terraces in the lower river basins at 70-80 m a.s.I. During a third stage the relaxation period, fluvial activity decreased and the land surface was increasingly occupied by a cover of tundra vegetation. A glacio-isostatic rebound resulted in a relative sea level fall and fluvial incision. During stages two and three the coast was exposed to shallow marine processes that aided the alignment of the coast. Stages one to three presumably lasted for less than 2000 years. During stage four, the stable period, lasting for several thousand years till the present, there were minor adjustments of shoreline and landscape. The four-step reconstruction describes the sedimentary response of a lowland fjord margin to dramatic changes in climate and sea level. The distribution of erosion and sedimentation during this development was mainly controlled by topography. The reconstruction of the latest environmental development of Jameson Land puts new light on Jameson Land's long and complex Quaternary stratigraphic record, The reconstruction may also be used as a model for the interpretation of deposits in similar areas elsewhere.},

This is consistent with the record of ice rafted detritus on the continental slope off the Scoresby Sund fjord complex, and suggests that the glacier had a polar regime with little surface melting or basal slide.},

The overall geological evolution of the study area can be separated into four distinct periods. During the Triassic and the Early Jurassic, E-W extension and the deposition of clastic sediments initiated the movement of the underlying Zechstein evaporites. The deposition ceased during the Middle Jurassic, when the entire area was uplifted as a result of the Mid North Sea Doming. The uplift resulted in a pronounced erosion of Upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic strata. This event is marked by a clear angular unconformity on all the seismic sections. The region remained an area of non-deposition until the end of the Early Cretaceous, when the sedimentation resumed in the area. Throughout the Late Cretaceous the sedimentation took place under tectonic quiescence. Reactivated salt movement is observed at the Cretaceous Cenozoic transition as a result of the change from an extensional to compressional regional stress field. The vertical salt movement influenced the Cenozoic sedimentation and resulted in thin-skinned faulting. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

We have developed the first continental-scale P-wave velocity model beneath Antarctica using an adaptively parameterized tomography approach that includes data from many new seismic networks. Our model shows considerable, previously unrecognized mantle heterogeneity, especially beneath West Antarctica. A pronounced slow velocity anomaly extends between Ross Island and Victoria Land, further grid south than previous studies indicate. However, at least for mantle depths $\geq${\~{}}200 km, this anomaly does not extend grid north along the Transantarctic Mountains (TAMs) and beneath the West Antarctic Rift System. The boundary between these slow velocities and fast velocities underlying East Antarctica is {\~{}}100-150 km beneath the front of the TAMs, consistent with flexural uplift models. The lateral extent of the low velocity anomaly is best explained by focused, rift-related decompression melting. In West Antarctica, Marie Byrd Land is underlain by a deep ({\~{}}800 km) low velocity anomaly. Synthetic tests illustrate that the low velocities also extend laterally below the transition zone, consistent with a mantle plume ponded below the 660 km discontinuity. The slow anomalies beneath Ross Island and Marie Byrd Land are separate features, highlighting the heterogeneous upper mantle of West Antarctica.},

In this study, we assess the usefulness of S wave receiver functions (SRFs), which are not affected by ice multiples, for investigating crustal structure beneath ice sheets by analyzing broadband seismic data recorded across the Transantarctic Mountains (TAMs) and the East Antarctic (EA) craton. Clear S-to-P (Sp) conversions from the Moho are obtained using standard SRF processing methods and are easier to interpret than the corresponding Ps conversion on PRFs. When the Sp-S times are modeled together with 16-20 s Rayleigh wave group velocities, we obtain Moho depth estimates of similar to 40-45 km for the EA craton, consistent with average Precambrian crustal thickness found globally but similar to 9 km thicker than previously reported estimates. A somewhat thinner crust (similar to 35-40 km) is obtained beneath the TAMs, suggesting that crustal buoyancy is at most a minor contributor to the uplift of the mountain range in this region.},

  abstract      = {The Transantarctic Mountains (TAMs) are the largest noncollisional mountain range on Earth. Their origin, as well as the origin of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin (WSB) along the inland side of the TAMs, has been widely debated, and a key constraint to distinguish between competing models is the underlying crustal structure. Previous investigations have examined this structure but have primarily focused on a small region of the central TAMs near Ross Island, providing little along-strike constraint. In this study, we use data from the new Transantarctic Mountains Northern Network and from five stations operated by the Korea Polar Research Institute to investigate the crustal structure beneath a previously unexplored portion of the TAMs. Using S wave receiver functions and Rayleigh wave phase velocities, crustal thickness and average crustal shear velocity (Vs) are resolved within $\pm$4km and $\pm$0.1 km/s, respectively. The crust thickens from {\~{}}20km near the Ross Sea coast to {\~{}}46km beneath the northern TAMs, which is somewhat thicker than that imaged in previous studies beneath the central TAMs. The crust thins to {\~{}}41km beneath the WSB. Vs ranges from {\~{}}3.1--3.9 km/s, with slower velocities near the coast. Our findings are consistent with a flexural origin for the TAMs and WSB, where these features result from broad flexure of the East Antarctic lithosphere and uplift along its western edge due to thermal conduction from hotter mantle beneath West Antarctica. Locally, thicker crust may explain the {\~{}}1km of additional topography in the northern TAMs compared to the central TAMs.},

In this study, new data from the Gamburtsev Antarctic Mountains Seismic Experiment (GAMSEIS) are presented, which substantially improve constraints on the crustal and upper mantle structure in this region. S-wave receiver functions and Rayleigh wave phase velocities are used to analyze data from the GAMSEIS deployment and to improve estimates of crustal thickness beneath the East Antarctic craton and the GSM. Our results indicate that the cratonic crust surrounding the GSM is {\~{}}. 40-45. km thick. Beneath the GSM, the crust thickens to {\~{}}. 55-58. km and provides isostatic support for the high mountain elevations. It has been suggested that thicker crust beneath the GSM may reflect magmatic underplating associated with a mantle plume. However, considering our results with those from other previous and ongoing studies, we instead favor models in which the GSM are an old continental feature associated with either Proterozoic or Paleozoic tectonic events. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract     = {Version 1.0 of the editorial of the EGU (European Geosciences Union) journal, Geoscientific Model Development (GMD), was published in 2013. In that editorial an assessment was made of the progress the journal had made since it started, and some revisions to the editorial policy were introduced. After 2 years of experience with this revised editorial policy there are a few required updates, refinements and clarifications, so here we present version 1.1 of the editorial. The most significant amendments relate to the peer-review criteria as presented in the Framework for GMD manuscript types, which is published as an appendix to this paper and also available on the GMD manuscript types webpage. We also slightly refine and update the Publication guide and introduce a self-contained code and data policy. The changes are summarised as follows: -- All manuscript types are now required to include code or data availability paragraphs, and model code must always be made available (in the case of copyright or other legal issues, to the editor at a minimum). -- The role of evaluation in GMD papers is clarified, and a separate evaluation paper type is introduced. Model descriptions must already be published or in peer review when separate evaluation papers are submitted. -- Observationally derived data should normally be published in a data journal rather than in GMD. Syntheses of data which were specifically designed for tasks such as model boundary conditions or direct evaluation of model output may, however, be published in GMD. -- GMD publishes a broad range of different kinds of models, and this fact is now more explicitly acknowledged. -- The main changes to the Publication guide are the addition of guidelines for editors when assessing papers at the initial review stage. Before sending papers for peer review, editors are required to make sure that papers comply with the Framework for GMD paper types and to carefully consider the topic of plagiarism. -- A new appendix, the GMD code and data policy, is included. Version 1.1 of the manuscript types and Publication guide are included in the appendices with changed sentences marked in bold font.},

  abstract     = {The Northern Hemisphere cooling event 8200 years ago is believed to represent the last known major freshwater pulse into the North Atlantic as a result of the final collapse of the North American Laurenticle ice sheet. This pulse of water is generally believed to have occurred independently of orbital variations and provides an analogue for predicted increases in high-latitude precipitation and ice melt as a result of anthropogenically driven future climate change. The precise timing, duration and magnitude of this event, however, are uncertain, with suggestions that the 100-yr meltwater sscooling formed part of a longer-term cold period in the early Holocene. Here we undertook a multiproxy, high-resolution investigation of a peat sequence at Dooagh, Achill Island, on the west coast of Ireland, to determine whether the 8200-year cold event impacted upon the terrestrial vegetation immediately 'downwind' of the proposed changes in the North Atlantic. We find clear evidence for an oscillation in the early Holocene using various measures of pollen, indicating a disruption in the vegetation leading to a grassland-dominated landscape, most probably driven by changes in precipitation rather than temperature. Radiocarbon dating was extremely problematic, however, with bulk peat samples systematically too young for the North Atlantic event, suggesting significant contamination from downward root penetration. The sustained disruption to vegetation over hundreds of years at Dooagh indicates the landscape was impacted by a long-term cooling event in the early Holocene, and not the single century length 8200-year meltwater event proposed in many other records in the North Atlantic region.

Such rapid growth of a large ice sheet requires significant amounts of moisture3, but the origin of this moisture has been unclear, particularly as the CLIMAP climate reconstruction suggests4,5 that the Greenland--Iceland--Norwegian (GIN) seas were perennially ice-covered during this period. Here we present data from deep-sea sediment cores from the Fram Strait, which suggest that relatively warm water from the North Atlantic Ocean was advected into the GIN seas in two short-term events (27--22.5 and 19.5--14.5 kyr ago). We suggest that the resulting seasonally ice-free waters were an important regional moisture source for the Barents Sea ice sheet, and that the GIN seas played a much more active role in climate during the last glaciation than has previously been supposed.},

  year      = {1997},
  abstract  = {Four sediment cores from the Fram Strait (78 degrees N) have been studied to reconstruct the paleoceanography of this major connection of the Arctic Ocean to the world ocean. Back to oxygen isotope stage 5 (128 kyr ago) the stratigraphic interpretation of the cores is based on oxygen isotope and accelerator mass spectrometry data; the identification of oxygen isotope stage 6 is based on paleomagnetic and coccolith data. Parameters indicative for contrasting environmental conditions such as high input of ice-rafted detritus (IRD) or seasonally open waters display characteristic sequences by which the paleoce anography of this region can be reconstructed for the last 180 kyr. The geographic setting of Fram Strait and the sediment data indicate a permanent meridional circulation pattern throughout the last 180 kyr, as it is typical, for example, for the present-day circulation. Depending on the strength of advection, Atlantic waters appeared in Fram Strait as surface waters, resulting in seasonally ice-free conditions, or as subsurface water masses, underlying polar waters perenially covered by ice. Sustained periods of seasonally ice-free waters were largely restricted to interglacial stages 5.5, 5.1, and the Holocene. However, a few short events characterized by seasonally ice-free conditions at 78 degrees N are recorded during glacial stages as well, for example, stage 6, late stage 3, and stage 2 (''Nordway'' events). These events provide for supply of moisture, and therefore they are closely related to the history of the European Arctic ice sheets. Strong input of IRD, reflecting severe glaciations on surrounding landmasses, occurred during most of stage 6, in early stage 3, and during stage 2. Variations in IRD input allow differentiation between three major source areas: (1) Svalbard/Barents Sea during major glacier advances in stages 2 to 5; (2) most likely Siberia during stage 6; and (3) Fennoscandia during the short events in glacial periods marked by seasonal open waters. Thus the circulation pattern in the Fram Strait remained rather stable throughout the last 180 kyr, while variations in the sediment composition are mainly due to the intensity of Atlantic water advection and to the prevailing IRD input pathway.},

The Vestfjella ferropicrites can be divided into two geochemical types: The depleted ferropicrites have (La/Sm)N of 1.2-1.3, (Sm/Yb)N of 4.5, initial ??Nd from + 7 to + 8, initial ??Sr from - 18 to - 19, and show relative depletion of highly incompatible elements, but pronounced enrichment of V; The enriched ferropicrites have (La/Sm)N of 1.7, (Sm/Yb)N of 5.1-5.4, initial ??Nd from + 3 to + 4, initial ??Sr from 0 to + 1, and show general enrichment of incompatible trace elements. The immobile incompatible element signatures of the ferropicrites have not been significantly affected by alteration, fractional crystallization, or contamination. Based on primitive olivine phenocrysts (Fo79-88) and high ??Nd values, the depleted ferropicrites represent near-primary melts derived from anomalous hot mantle sources. Overall, geochemical compositions favor a pyroxenite source for the ferropicrites. Unusually high (V/Lu)N values of the depleted ferropicrites indicate an affinity to oceanic Fe-Ti gabbros and geochemical modeling favors such a recycled mantle source component in them. The enriched ferropicrites probably represent near-primary melts, but this cannot be confirmed. They may also record an exceptionally Fe-rich source component, but their high Fe contents stem at least partly from relatively low-degree melting at high pressures, as indicated by the high (La/Sm)N and (Sm/Yb)N ratios. Examination of a global ferropicrite dataset reveals that the recycled Fe-Ti gabbro component is detectable in many ferropicrites. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {The structure of the upper mantle beneath the Australian continent is investigated using teleseismic shear wave splitting to extract seismic anisotropy. Measurements have been performed on data recorded at 190 sites with portable broadband seismic recorders, spanning almost the entire surface of the continent since 1992. The average time span of the various deployments, primarily designed for surface wave tomography, is 6 months, which is rather limited for shear wave splitting analysis. However, the data set provides a full continental scale survey using the reasonably favourable distribution of seismicity to Australia. Seismic anisotropy has the potential to provide insights into the lithospheric structure and the possible mechanical coupling between the crust and the upper mantle, but prior results for Australia have indicated relatively small levels of splitting and a complex pattern. These results are confirmed with our new and far more extensive measurements across the whole continent. The pattern of seismic anisotropy from shear wave splitting beneath Australia is rather complex and is not correlated with the almost north-south absolute plate motion (APM) from recent models. Deviation of the asthenospheric mantle flow around the lithospheric roots associated with the extensive Archaean and Proterozoic zones of central and western Australia could be occurring, and so mantle flow-related anisotropy cannot be completely ruled out. Despite the limited geological outcrop, especially in Phanerozoic eastern Australia, that is almost entirely covered by sedimentary basins, some relationships can be highlighted between the orientation of the polarization plane of the fast S-waves and structural trends along, for instance, the Halls Creek orogen bordering the eastern edge of the Kimberley basin or along the New England and Lachlan fold belts in the southeastern part of the continent. Such relationships might account for anisotropy frozen in the lithosphere during post-tectonic thermal relaxation. Along the poorly constrained and controversial Tasman Line (TL), the geological boundary between Precambrian and Phanerozoic Australia, directions of anisotropy measured at some stations located in the close vicinity of the 'line' appear to exhibit a curvilinear trend somewhat similar to that of the TL, suggesting that fossil deformation associated with the TL might be recorded in the pattern of seismic anisotropy. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {Palaeogeographic and tectono-stratigraphic considerations in the greater Barents Sea show that the distribution of reservoirs and hydrocarbon source rocks from the Late Palaeozoic to the Palaeogene can be related to three tectonic phases. Firstly, the Palaeozoic Caledonain Orogeny caused uplift to the west, followed by eastward sediment distribution across the shelf, towards carbonate platforms to the east. Secondly the Late Palaeozoic--Mesozoic Uralide Orogeny induced uplift to the east, causing widespread clastic deposition and reversal of the sediment distribution pattern. Thirdly, major Late Mesozoic--Cenozoic rifting and crustal breakup in the western Barents Sea led to the current basin configuration. Reservoir rocks comprise Late Palaeozoic carbonates and spiculites, Mesozoic terrestrial and marine sandstones and Palaeogene deep-water sandstones. Hydrocarbon source rocks range in age from Silurian to Early Cretaceous, and are grouped into three petroleum systems derived from Late Palaeozoic, Triassic and Late Jurassic source rocks. Multiple tectonic episodes caused formation of a variety of trap types, of which extensional fault blocks and gently folded domes have been the most prospective. Volumetric considerations of generated petroleum indicate that charging is not a limiting factor, except in the western margin.},

This has led to the development of so-called  banana-doughnut [sensitivity] kernels'--hereinafter BDKs. Here we address a practical question: has the use of these kernels produced tomographic images of global mantle heterogeneity that are significantly better than those based on ray theory? A simple model comparison suggests that the answer is  not yet'. The effect of BDKs on both the pattern and the amplitude of mantle wavespeed perturbations appears to be smaller than that of practical (and subjective) considerations (such as the level of damping, the weighting of different data sets, and the choice of data fit) and does not exceed realistic estimates of image uncertainty due to, for instance, errors in the data. By itself, the fact that the better theory has not yet resulted in significant model improvements does not imply that models based on BDKs are incorrect. Deep  plumes' may very well exist, but the benificial effect of BDKs on the tomographic images (and on  plume' identification in particular) has been overstated.$\backslash$n},

The models are highly correlated. There are (of course) differences, and some anomalies in the banana-doughnut models have higher amplitudes (perhaps by as much as 50 per cent or more) than in the ray theoretical models. However, this occurs mainly for small, weak anomalies, whose resolution by long period data has not been demonstrated. Because of differences in data and inversion strategy, and in absence of a 'ground truth', comparisons of MIT and PRI models do not provide insight into the efficacy and validity of BDKs or the accuracy of the models. With regard to plumes: if they indeed exist and have the appearance as suggested by Montelli et al. then our models are-in that respect-inaccurate. However, this is unrelated to the main point of our paper.},

These volcanoes were dubbed "petit-spots". The petit-spot volcanic province represents more than 8 Myr of activity over a large area (similar to 600 km along the direction of plate motion), but with a relatively small volume of magma production, thus indicating a small supply of heat inconsistent with a hotspot. The low-flux petit-spot volcanoes may be related to the occurrence of a tensional field of lithosphere caused by plate flexure, with the ascending melt derived from a mantle source susceptible to partial melting. Rock samples from the young volcanoes are highly vesicular (up to 60{\%}) despite high hydrostatic pressures at 6000 m water depth, indicating volatile-rich magmas. The depleted heavy rare earth elements and high radiometric isotopic ratios of noble gases indicate the magma was derived from upper mantle. Nevertheless, the low Nd-143/Nd-144, high Sr-87/Sr-86, low Pb-206/Pb-204 and low Pb-207/Pb-204 ratios are similar to enriched or fertile compositions such as oceanic island basalts. These apparently conflicting data are explained by the extremely small degree of partial melting of recycled materials in the degassing mantle of the asthenosphere, probably with carbonate in the source. The petit-spot volcanoes, therefore, provide a unique window into the nature of the oceanic plate and underlying asthenosphere prior to subduction.},

Small alkalic volcanoes form from small percent melts and originate in the asthenosphere, as implied by their trace element geochemistry and noble gas isotopic compositions. We propose that these small volcanoes erupt along lithospheric fractures in response to plate flexure during subduction. Minor extents of asthenospheric melting and the volcanoes' tectonic alignment and age progression in the direction opposite to that of plate motion provide evidence for the presence of a small percent melt in the asthenosphere.},

We analyze conductivity profiles for an Archean craton and an oceanic setting, in conjunction with independent constraints on mantle geotherms, to estimate the water content of the upper mantle in these very different geologic environments. Results from this analysis indicate that the Archean lithosphere contains less water than the oceanic mantle in the depth range between $\sim$150 and $\sim$250 km. Below $\sim$250 km these oceanic and continental environments show similar conductivities, suggesting that the water content of the mantle does not vary significantly between $\sim$250 km and the 410-km discontinuity. These observations indicate that the Archean lithosphere may be stabilized against convective instabilities partly because it has a high viscosity associated with a dry composition.},

However, variations in onshore and offshore chalk properties will expectedly occur due to different diagenetic history. Understanding diagenetic mechanisms and their consequences are thus a key issue when reservoir chalk characterization is based on outcrop chalk. In chalk of the Valhall field high pore pressure and hydrocarbon presence have counteracted recrystallization and cementation and preserved high porosity despite a burial depth of c. 3 km. As a consequence inter-particle connections are poorly developed and Valhall chalk is expectedly geomechanically weak. Similar high porosity and weak consolidation were observed in Danish outcrop chalk which expectedly will match the Valhall samples geomechanically. In chalk of the Dan, South Arne and Ekofisk fields recrystallization and cementation features are significantly better developed compared to the Valhall field. Calcite redistribution has strengthened particle contacts and reduced porosity, assumingly providing a geomechanically stronger chalk. Similar low porosity and well-developed recrystallization and cementation features are found in English chalk which from a geomechanical point of view may share characteristics with chalk of the Dan, South Arne and Ekofisk fields. Matrix permeability is related not only to porosity but also to specific surface area of chalk which is controlled partly by calcite recrystallization partly by type and amount of non-carbonate minerals. In onshore chalk significant mineralogical differences are reflected in varying specific surface area. In contrast, specific surface area of Upper Cretaceous reservoir chalk show little variation indicating that care must be taken when choosing an outcrop chalk as substitute for reservoir chalk during flooding experiments. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {Cenozoic, mafic alkaline volcanic rocks throughout West Antarctica (WA) occupy diverse tectonic environments. On the Antarctic Peninsula (AP), late Miocene-Pleistocene (7 to {\textless} 1 Ma) alkaline basaltic rocks were erupted {\textless} 1 to 45 million years after subduction ceased along the Pacific margin of the AP. In Marie Byrd Land (MBL), by contrast, alkaline basaltic volcanism has been semi-continuous from 25-30 Ma to the present, and occurs in the West Antarctic rift system. Together, these Antarctic tectono-magmatic associations are analogous to the Basin and Range, Sierran, and Coast Range batholith provinces. Unlike the western US, however, basaltic rocks throughout WA have uniform geochemical characteristics, with especially narrow ranges in initial Sr-87/Sr-86 (0.7026-0.7035), Nd-143/Nd-144 (0.51286-0.51299), and La/Nb (0.6-1.4) ratios, suggesting very limited input from ''old'' subcontinental lithosphere or crustal sources during magma genesis. However, there are significant differences in the relative and absolute abundances of the LILE (large-ion-lithophile elements), and these divide WA into two provinces. Basalts from the AP region have unusually high K/Ba and K/Rb ratios (50-140 and 500-1500 respectively) and marked Ba depletion (Ba/Nb = 2.5-8.0; Ba ppm 66-320) relative to MBL basalts, which have LILE distributions within the range for OIB (ocean-island basalt) (K/Ba {\textless} 50, Ba/Nb 5-20). This geochemical contrast is accompanied by a three-fold increase in the age range of volcanic activity and a three orders of magnitude increase in the volume of eruptive products, within MBL. The regional differences in geochemistry, and in the volume and duration of volcanic activity, are best explained by a plume-related origin for MBL basalts, whereas alkaline magmatism in the AP is causally related to slab window formation following the cessation of subduction. Plume activity has already been proposed to explain tectonic doming and associated spatial patterns of volcanism in MBL. Most MBL geochemical traits are shared by the volcanic rocks of the western Ross Sea, suggesting that a large plume head underlies the West Antarctic rift system. The uniformity of basalt compositions throughout WA and the entire rift system suggest uniformly minimal extension throughout this region during late Cenozoic time. Differences in crustal thicknesses can be explained by early Cenozoic or pre-Cenozoic extension, but restraint on extension is suggested by the size of the region and the implied size of the plume. The c. 95{\%} encirclement of the Antarctic plate by mid-ocean ridges and transforms restrains extension on a regional scale, leading to non-adiabatic plume rise and correspondingly little decompression melting.},

Between 200 ka and 13 ka the fjord was free of ice for {\~{}} 120 k.y. Assuming a similar sediment delivery rate during this ice-free time, {\~{}} 200 km 3 of sediment would have accumulated in the fjord. An alternative calculation based on erosion rates suggests that 400 km 3 could have been delivered to Isfjorden during this 120 k.y. Seismic studies have identified a {\~{}} 330 km 3 package of sediment on the continental shelf and slope west of Isfjorden. This sediment is believed to have accumulated between 200 ka and 13 ka. Herein we argue that this is sediment that was originally deposited in the fjord, and that it was transferred to the shelf by glaciers in the {\~{}} 70 ka during which the fjord was occupied by ice. Calculations using a steady-state numerical model suggest that the sediment could have been moved in a deforming layer of subglacial till and in subglacial melt streams at rates of 7.6 $\times$ 106 m 3 a-l and 0.3 $\times$ 106 m 3 a-1, respectively, resulting in a total flux of {\~{}} 7.9 $\times$ 106 m 3 a- I. It is unlikely that much sediment was moved in a basal layer of dirty ice, as intense basal melting would have inhibited sediment entrainment. Of the time that glaciers occupied the fjord, {\~{}} 60{\%} would have been required to evacuate the accumulated sediment. During the remaining time, the ice could have been deepening the fjord.},

High-resolution radiocarbon dates, magnetic susceptibility and lithostratigraphic evidence from a lake sediment core from Nedre Hervavatnet located at Sygnefjell in western Norway provide a record of the early Holocene. We use the method of radiocarbon wiggle-match dating of the lake sediments using the non-linear relationship between the 14C calibration curve and the consecutive accumulation order of the sample series in order to build a high-resolution age-model. The timing and duration of Holocene environmental changes is estimated using 38 AMS radiocarbon dates on terrestrial macrofossils, insects and chironomids covering the time period from 9750 to 1180 cal BP. Chironomids, Salix and Betula leaves produce the most consistent results. Sedimentological and physical properties of the core suggest that three meltwater events with high sedimentation rates are superimposed on a long-term trend with glacier retreat between 9750 and 8000 cal BP. The lake sediment sequence of Nedre Hervavatnet demonstrates the following: only a reliable high-resolution geochronology based on carefully selected terrestrial macrofossils allows the reconstruction of a more refined and complex environmental change history before and during the 8.2 ka event. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract     = {A rock avalanche deposit was investigated in order to understand the chronological evolution of geological hazards and to evaluate the interaction of the triggering geodynamic processes in the valley Val Viola, Italian Alps. The deposit is situated west of the Alpe Dosd??, in a permafrost area with deep-seated gravitational deformations (DSGD) along a tectonic line. Based on its geomorphologic context, the rock avalanche was first interpreted as a result of slope stress release without exact timing. This hypothesis was tested by measuring the 10Be exposure date of quartz from one boulder from the rock avalanche. The age of 7430??460 years places the event in the early Holocene. The timing of the last deglaciation was constrained using the inner late glacial moraine of a moraine doublet in the valley Alpe Dosd?? situated at an altitude between 2140 and 2120 m a.s.l. west of the rock avalanche. The 10Be concentrations of quartz yield minimum exposure ages of 11,480??670 and 10,850??820 years. Different proposals for potential triggering factors of the rock avalanche include (a) melting of the local valley glacier and slope stress release in the Val Viola, likely to play a minor role as trigger, because of the time delay between the deglaciation and the rock avalanche event. More likely are (b) enhanced crustal seismicity induced by post-glacial regional isostatic glacial rebound coupled with tectonic stress or/and (c) climate conditions with higher temperatures around 7430??460 years, resulting in an upwards movement of the permafrost limit and destabilization of the rock walls. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.},

  abstract     = {Accurate geochronologies are the key for comparison of palaeoclimate records. In order to clarify problems concerning the geochronology of glacier fluctuations we dated palaeosols in moraines in the Kebnekaise mountain region of Swedish Lapland. These palaeosols already have been dated several years ago using bulk samples of the palaeosols and yielded ages of 6180-5790 and 2750-2100calyrBP. In an attempt to evaluate the sources of contamination associated with bulk samples these soils were re-dated by using Coleoptera fragments, Cenococcum geophilum spores, humic acids and woody plant tissues. The new dates reveal that the two palaeosols found within the moraines represent much longer periods of time than was previously assumed. Soil formation periods can be distinguished for periods 7800-7580, 6300-4080, 2450-2000 and 1170-740cal yr BP. These age groups point to differentiated soil formation processes, resedimentation, bioturbation and/or cryoturbation. The results show that dated terrestrial macrofossils from glacial moraines indicate climate changes that are in accordance with other proxy records in northern and central Scandinavia and in certain times off-phase with glacier fluctuations in southern maritime Norway. This throws light on possible changing interaction of forcing factors during the Holocene. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

An interstadial sequence ca. 40-30 kyr BP with boreo-arctic proglacial fjords and subarctic flora and occasional glaciation in the Baltic was succeeded by a Last Glacial Maximum sequence ca. 3020 kyr BP, with the closure of fjords and subsequent ice streams in glacial lake basins in Kattegat and the Baltic.

A deglaciation sequence ca. 20-15 kyr BP indicates the transgression of arctic waters, retreat of the Swedish ice and advance of Baltic ice streams succeeded by a return to interstadial conditions. When ameliorated ice-free conditions prevailed in maritime regions, glaciers advanced through the Baltic and when interstadial regimes dominated the Baltic, glaciers expanded off the Norwegian coast.

These strata include the Kingak Shale, a succession of depositional sequences influenced by rift opening of the Arctic Ocean Basin. Interpretation of sequence stratigraphy and depositional facies from a regional two-dimensional seismic grid and well data allows the definition of four sequence sets that each displays unique stratal geometries and thickness trends across NPRA. A Lower to Middle Jurassic sequence set includes numerous transgressive-regressive sequences that collectively built a clastic shelf in north-central NPRA. Along the south-facing, lobate shelf margin, condensed shales in transgressive systems tracts downlap and coalesce into a basinal condensed section that is likely an important hydrocarbon source rock. An Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian sequence set, deposited during pulses of uplift on the Barrow arch, includes multiple transgressive-regressive sequences that locally contain well-winnowed, shoreface sandstones at the base of transgressive systems tracts. These shoreface sandstones and overlying shales, deposited during maximum flooding, form stratigraphic traps that are the main objective of exploration in the Alpine play in NPRA. A Valanginian sequence set includes at least two transgressive-regressive sequences that display relatively distal characteristics, suggesting high relative sea level. An important exception is the presence of a basal transgressive systems tract that locally contains shoreface sandstones of reservoir quality, A Hauterivian sequence set includes two transgressive-regressive sequences that constitute a shelf-margin wedge developed as the result of tectonic uplift along the Barrow arch during rift opening of the Arctic Ocean Basin. This sequence set displays stratal geometries suggesting incision and synsedimentary collapse of the shelf margin.},

  abstract     = {Trace-element analysis of the calcareous shells of ostracodes in a sediment core from Farewell Lake provides the first limnogeochemical record for climatic reconstructions in Alaska. When compared with pollen data from the same site, this record offers new insights into climatic controls over vegetation dynamics during the Holocene. The low Mg/Ca ratios and high Sr/Ca ratios suggest that a relatively cold dry climate prevailed in this region between 11,000 and 9000 yr B.P. (uncalibrated super(14)C ages are used throughout the paper). This result contrasts with previous interpretations of a thermal maximum at this time, corresponding to the widespread establishment of Populus woodland/forest. The trace-element record suggests, instead, that the warmest period of the early Holocene at Farewell Lake was between 8500 and 8000 yr B.P. during the decline of Populus. Marked decreases in Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca suggest a major increase in effective moisture around 6500 yr B.P., which coincided with the establishment of Picea boreal forests in the Farewell Lake region. This climatic change was probably widespread throughout much of Alaska and adjacent Canada and might have induced the rapid spread of Alnus and the shift from Picea glauca to P. mariana dominance across that region. Our geochemical record also suggests that the late-Holocene climate history was more complex than previously thought on the basis of palynological studies. According to this record, growing-season temperatures increased 6000-4500 yr B.P., decreased 4500-1500 yr B.P., and increased with fluctuations afterward. After 6000 yr B.P. stratigraphic changes in pollen percentages of Picea appear to be positively related with those of Mg/Ca. This relationship implies that once the threshold of effective moisture was crossed for the establishment of Picea forests temperature was the primary control of Picea population density},

A series of sensitivity experiments reveal that Iceland is susceptible to the onset large-scale glaciation with only a 3 ??C cooling perturbation relative to recent (1961-1990) climate. A 5 ??C cooling perturbation is enough to force an ice sheet to beyond the present day coastline in virtually all sectors. A suite of 15 experiments driven by a GRIP ?? 18O time-series for 15,000 years from a climatic optimum at 36 ka to 21 ka BP scaled with 5.0-15.0 ??C maximum cooling perturbation are initiated in order to identify a best-fit LGM ice sheet configuration compatible with the available empirical evidence. The optimum LGM model isolated requires an annual cooling of 10.0-12.5 ??C relative to the recent climatology with over 50{\%} precipitation suppression across the north and yields an extensive offshore ice sheet with an area of 3.29 ?? 105 km2 and a volume of 3.09 ?? 105 km3. Over-extension of ice extent across the northern shelf is addressed by the introduction of strong aridity across this region but otherwise the ice-sheet is well pinned to the continental shelf-break in remaining sectors which tends to decouple it from further climatic forcing. The optimum LGM ice-sheet has a substantial proportion of its base grounded below sea-level and is dominated by basal sliding which activates extensive zones of fast flow. This results in a highly dynamic, low aspect ice sheet with a mean ice thickness of 940 m and a plateau elevation of ??? 2000 m breached by numerous nunataks and ice-free zones providing potential, but spatially limited and frigid, ecological refugia through the vicissitudes of the LGM. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The palaeoglaciological boundary conditions are defined by geological data on timing and extent of the last glaciation obtained in the course of the EU funded project "Eurasian Ice Sheets". These data prove beyond any doubt, that with the exception of the northwestern fringe of the Taymyr Peninsula, the rest of the Eurasian mainland and Severnaya Zemlya were not affected by the Barents-Kara Sea Ice Sheet during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Inversed modelling based on these results shows that a progressive cooling which started around 30ka BP, caused ice growth in Scandinavia and the northwestern areas of the Barents-Kara Sea shelf, due to a maritime climate with relatively high precipitation along the western flank of the developing ice sheets. In the rest of the Eurasian Arctic extremely low precipitation rates (less than 50mmyr-1), did not allow ice sheet growth in spite of the very cold temperatures. Palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental conditions for the time prior to, during, and after the LGM have been reconstructed for the non-glaciated areas around the LGM ice sheet with the use of faunal and vegetation records, permafrost, eolian sediments, alluvial deposits and other evidences. The changing environment, from interstadial conditions around 30ka BP to a much colder and drier environment at the culmination of the LGM at 20-15ka BP, and the beginning of warming around 15ka BP have been elaborated from the field data, which fits well with the modelling results. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract     = {Following common usage, we broaden the term "salt" to include all rock bodies composed primarily of halite (NaCl). Salt is mechanically weak and flows like a fluid, even at geologically rapid strain rates. Salt is also relatively incompressible so is less dense than most carbonates and all moderately to fully compacted siliciclastic rocks. Salt's fluid rheology and incompressibility make it inherently unstable under a wide range of geologic conditions. The primary driving force for salt tectonics is differential loading, which may be induced by gravitational forces, by forced displacement of one boundary of a salt body relative to another, or by a thermal gradient. Buoyancy, long considered a key driver for salt tectonics, is of secondary importance in many settings. Two factors resist salt flow: strength of the overburden and boundary drag along the edges of the salt body. Salt will move only if driving forces exceed the resistance to flow. In order for a salt diapir to be emplaced into its overburden, any rock previously occupying that space must be removed or displaced. Emplacement may occur by extension, erosion, or uplift of the overburden or by overthrusting of the salt. Once salt reaches the surface, it can continue to rise by passive diapirism, in which the diapir grows as sediments accumulate around it. A rapidly rising passive diapir may spread over the sediment surface to form an allochthonous salt sheet. A variety of salt-sheet lineages are possible, depending on the geometry of the feeder and the tectonic setting. Because salt is weak, its tectonism is closely tied to regional deformation. In extension or transtension, diapirs rise up graben axes, taking advantage of the space created by thinning and separation of fault blocks. Later, once the salt source layer is exhausted, diapirs may fall as they continue to widen. In addition, salt typically acts as a detachment in both gravity-driven and basement-involved extension. In compression or transpression, preexisting diapirs are rejuvenated as salt is displaced upward by lateral shortening. This rise is enhanced by buckling and disruption of the diapir roof. In the absence of precursor structures, salt's primary role in compression is to act as a detachment. Some salt sheets may be emplaced in the hanging walls of thrust faults. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {Two distinct stages of extension are recognized in the West Antarctic Rift system (WARS). During the first stage, beginning in the Late Cretaceous, extension was broadly distributed throughout much of West Antarctica. A second stage of extension in the late Paleogene was focused primarily in the Victoria Land Basin, near the boundary with the East Antarctic craton. The transition to focused extension was roughly coeval with volcanic activity and strike-slip faulting in the adjacent Transantarctic Mountains. This spatial and temporal correspondence suggests that the transition in extensional style could be the result of a change in plate motions or impingement of a plume. Here we use finite element models to study the processes and conditions responsible for the two-stage evolution of rifting in the WARS. Model results indicate that the transition from a prolonged period of broadly distributed extension to a later period of focused rifting did not require a change in the regional stress regime (changes in plate motion), or deep mantle thermal state (impingement of a plume). Instead, we attribute the transition from diffuse to focused extension to an early stage dominated by the initially weak accreted lithosphere of West Antarctica, and a later stage that concentrated around a secondary weakness located at the boundary between the juvenile West Antarctica lithosphere and Precambrian East Antarctic craton. The modeled transition in extension from the initially weak West Antarctica region to the secondary weakness at the West Antarctic-East Antarctic boundary is precipitated by strengthening of the West Antarctica lithosphere during syn-extensional thinning and cooling. The modeled syn-extensional strengthening of the WARS lithosphere promotes a wide-rift mode of extension between 105 and ??? 65??Ma. By ??? 65??Ma most of the extending WARS region becomes stronger than the area immediately adjacent to the East Antarctic craton and extension becomes concentrated near the East Antarctic/West Antarctic boundary, forming the Victoria Land Basin region. Mantle necking in this region leads to syn-extensional weakening that promotes a narrow-rift mode of extension that becomes progressively more focused with time, resulting in formation of the Terror Rift in the western Victoria Land Basin. The geodynamic models demonstrate that the transition from diffuse to focused extension occurs only under a limited set of initial and boundary conditions, and is particularly sensitive to the pre-rift thermal state of the crust and upper mantle. Models that predict diffuse extension in West Antarctica followed by localization of rifting near the boundary between East and West Antarctica require upper mantle temperatures of 730 ?? 50????C and sufficient concentration of heat producing elements in the crust to account for ??? 50{\%} of the upper mantle temperature. Models with upper mantle temperatures {\textless} ca. 680????C and/or less crustal heat production initially undergo diffuse extension in West Antarctica, and quickly develop a lithospheric neck at the model edge furthest from East Antarctica. Models with upper mantle temperatures {\textgreater} ca. 780????C do not develop focused rifts, and predict indefinite diffuse extension in West Antarctica. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Radiometric dating, using Pb-210 and Pu, shows that the light- and dark-coloured laminae couplets are annually deposited varves. Dark laminae thickness is strongly correlated to average June temperature from Kimmirut (r = 0.82), reflecting the influence of temperature on snowmelt and fluxes of runoff and suspended sediment. This relationship allowed the construction of a palaeotemperature record that documents large-amplitude interannual to decadal variability superimposed on distinct century-scale trends, including 2 degrees C average warming and maximum temperatures during the 1900s. Similar patterns of change are seen in individual and regionally averaged palaeotemperature records from around the circum-Arctic. Upper Soper Lake records temperatures, rates of change and Variance during the twentieth century that are all anomalously high within the context of the last 500 years, and outside the observed range of natural variability. Comparisons of Upper Soper Lake and Arctic average palaeotemperature to proxy-records of hypothesized forcing mechanisms suggest that the recent warming trend is mostly due to anthropogenic emissions of atmospheric greenhouse gases. The magnitude of the warming and decade-scale variability throughout the records, however, indicate that natural forcing mechanisms such as changing solar irradiance and volcanic activity, as well as positive feedbacks within the Arctic environment, also play an important role.},

The time-slice maps of ice-sheet extent are based on a new Geographical Information System (GIS) database, where we have collected published numerical dates constraining the timing of ice-sheet advance and retreat, and additionally geomorphological and geological evidence contained within the existing literature. We integrate all uncertainty estimates into three ice-margin lines for each time-slice; a most-credible line, derived from our assessment of all available evidence, with bounding maximum and minimum limits allowed by existing data. This approach was motivated by the demands of glaciological, isostatic and climate modelling and to clearly display limitations in knowledge. The timing of advance and retreat were both remarkably spatially variable across the ice-sheet area. According to our compilation the westernmost limit along the British--Irish and Norwegian continental shelf was reached up to 7000 years earlier (at c. 27--26 ka) than the eastern limit on the Russian Plain (at c. 20--19 ka). The Eurasian ice sheet complex as a whole attained its maximum extent (5.5 Mkm2) and volume ({\~{}}24 m Sea Level Equivalent) at c. 21 ka. Our continental-scale approach highlights instances of conflicting evidence and gaps in the ice-sheet chronology where uncertainties remain large and should be a focus for future research. Largest uncertainties coincide with locations presently below sea level and where contradicting evidence exists.

  abstract     = {Much renewed research interest in Arctic regions stems from the increasing concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases and the alleged climatic sensitivity of high latitude areas. Glacier and permafrost changes are among a number of proxies used for monitoring past and present Arctic climate change. Here we present observations on frozen in situ soil and vegetation, found below cold-based glacier Longyearbreen (78$\neg$$\infty$ 13'N), 2 km upstream from the present glacier terminus. Dating of the relict vegetation indicates that the glacier has increased in length from about 3 km to its present size of about 5 km during the last c. 1100 years. The meteorological setting of non-surging Longyearbreen suggests this example of late-Holocene glacier growth represents a widespread phenomenon in Svalbard and in adjoining Arctic regions. In addition, we use the subglacial permafrozen soil system to evaluate microbial survival capacity over considerable time periods, and we present evidence for microbes having survived more than 1100 years in a subglacial, permafrozen state.},

  abstract     = {Starting with the Laramide orogeny and continuing through the Cenozoic, the U.S. Cordilleran orogen is unusual for its width, nature of uplift, and style of tectonic and magmatic activity. We present teleseismic tomography evidence for a thickness of modified North America lithosphere greater than or equal to200 km beneath Colorado and {\textgreater}100 km beneath New Mexico. Existing explanations for uplift or magmatism cannot accommodate lithosphere this thick. Imaged mantle structure is low in seismic velocity roughly beneath the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and New Mexico, and high in velocity to the east and west, beneath the tectonically intact Great Plains and Colorado Plateau. Structure internal to the low-velocity volume has a NE grain suggestive of influence by inherited Precambrian sutures. We conclude that the high-velocity upper mantle is Precambrian lithosphere, and the low-velocity volume is partially molten Precambrian North America mantle. We suggest, as others have, that the Farallon stab was in contact with the lithosphere beneath most of the western U.S. during the Laramide orogeny. We further suggest that slab de-watering under the increasingly cool conditions of slab contact with North America hydrated the base of the continental lithosphere, causing a steady regional uplift of the western U.S. during the Laramide orogeny. Imaged low-velocity upper mantle is attributed to hydration-induced lithospheric melting beneath much of the southern Rocky Mountains. Laramide-age magmatic ascent heated and weakened the lithosphere, which in turn allowed horizontal shortening to occur in the mantle beneath the region of Laramide thrusting in the southern Rocky Mountains. Subsequent Farallon slab removal resulted in additional uplift through unloading. It also triggered vigorous magmatism, especially where asthenosphere made contact with the hydrated and relatively thin and fertile lithosphere of what now is the Basin and Range. This mantle now is dry, depleted of basaltic components, hot, buoyant, and weak.},

  abstract     = {Two important problems of continental tectonics may be resolved by recognizing that most subduction zone backarcs have hot, thin, and weak lithospheres over considerable widths. These are (1) the origin of long-lived active "mobile belts" contrasted to the stability of cratons and platforms, and (2) the origin of the heat of continental collision orogeny. At many continental margin plate boundaries, there are broad belts with a long history of distributed deformation. These regions are mobile because the lithosphere is sufficiently weak to be deformed by the forces developed at plate boundaries. We conclude that mobile belts are weak because they are hot, and they are hot as a consequence of their position in present or recent backarcs. Most continental backarcs have thin and hot lithospheres, not just those with active extension or rifting. Moho temperatures are 800-900 degrees C and lithosphere thicknesses are 50-60 km, compared to 400-500 degrees C and 150-300 km for cratons and other regions with a thermotectonic age greater than ca. 300 Ma. The temperature differences result in backarc lithospheres that are weaker than cratons by more than a factor of 10. Backarcs may be hot because shallow asthenosphere convection results from the reduction in viscosity due to water rising from the underlying subducting plate. Hot, weak, former backarcs are expected to be the locus of most deformation during continent or terrane collision orogeny. The heat indicated by orogenic plutonism, high grade metamorphism, and ductile deformation may come from the preexisting hot backarc lithosphere, not from the orogenic deformation process itself.},

  abstract     = {The Antarctic Ice Sheet, containing 25-30 x 106 km 3 of glacial ice (Drewry et al., 1982; Vaughan 2000), is the largest glacial system on Earth. The western part of the present Antarctic Ice Sheet (West Antarctic Ice Sheet, WAIS), west of the Transantarctic Mountains (Fig. 1), is largely marine-based, currently very dynamic and discharges huge volumes of ice to floating ice shelves through large ice-stream systems. To the east of the Transantarctic Mountains the current East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) is predominantly terrestrial, relatively stable and has limited discharge into surrounding ice shelves (Fig. 2). The WAIS and EAIS contain about 3.3 x 106 km 3 and 26 x 106 km 3 of ice, respectively (Drewry, 1983; Denton et al., 1991). The Antarctic Ice Sheet, potentially containing 57-66 m of sea level equivalent (Denton et al., 1991; Vaughan 2000), is a critical factor in regulating, modifying and forcing the global climate and oceanographic system. Throughout most of the late Cenozoic the Antarctic Ice Sheet has driven global eustasy and deep-ocean circulation, and acted as a regulator of global climate (Anderson, 1999). However, the influences of Antarctic Ice Sheet fluctuations in the Quaternary history of global climate, after initiation of major glaciations in the Northern Hemisphere, are not yet well understood. More than 98{\%} of the Antarctic continent is today covered by glacier ice, and the potential on land for obtaining high-resolution geological data pertaining to its glacial history is poor. A fundamental question is what caused the glacial fluctuations observed in the records? Antarctic glaciers respond both to global sea level fluctuations, mainly controlled during the Quaternary by developments in the Northern Hemisphere, and to Southern Hemisphere climate changes. A good under- standing of the late Quaternary glacial and climate history of Antarctica will constrain the contribution of Antarctic ice to the global sea-level- and marine oxygen-isotope records, and is important for understanding the relative timing of climate changes between the polar hemispheres (Denton et al., 1989; Clapperton {\&} Sugden, 1990; Colhoun et al., 1992; Moriwaki et aL, 1992; Quilty, 1992; Blunier et al., 1998; Steig et al., 1998).},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a summary of the evidence for glacial and climatic changes during the late Pleistocene-early Holocene transition in Iceland. The deglaciation during the Bolling-Allerod event was interrupted by a short-lived Older Dryas glacial advance. A biostratigraphical record from northern Iceland shows significant climate warming in late Allerod, when mean July temperatures were at least as warm as those of today. An abrupt cooling marked the beginning of the Younger Dryas event. It was characterised by a cold and stable polar climate and an extensive glaciation, before the postglacial warming of climate set in. The Icelandic paleoclimatic record is discussed in the light of climatic oscillations recorded from the GRIP ice-core, from the Greenland Inland Ice, and with reference to major shifts in the oceanic front systems, recorded in the Troll 8903 marine sediment core from the North Sea. The Vedde Ash gives a unique opportunity to address the chronological problems and correlate event stratigraphies of the different proxies. It is concluded that the Icelandic record of glacial and climatic changes during the late Pleistocene-early Holocene transition largely reflects the climatic development in the North Atlantic region.},

The massive ground ice contains deformation structures and deformed sediment rafts that show a consistent direction of deforming force. It is bounded upwards with a sharp and unconformable thaw contact to overlying till. The stratigraphical and structural evidence suggests that the massive ground ice body is relict glacier ice. Examination of data from a separate study on ice crystallography and isotopic composition of the massive ice body does not contradict this conclusion. The isotope composition and profiles conform with what can be expected for deformed basal ice. The chronology for the Shpindler Cape sequence implies that the glacier ice might be older than 250\hspace{0.167em}ka years. Consequently, permafrost has preserved the relict glacier ice for the duration of at least two interglacials (Eemian and Holocene), as well as several Saalian and Weichselian interstadials, illustrating the preservation potential of the permafrost.

Till fabrics indicate ice movements controlled by the local topography, while glaciotectonic deformations suggest that ice moved from an ice divide northeast of Kongs{\&}oslash;ya. independent of the local topography. The stratigraphical evidences show two pre-Holocene ice-free periods, when the climate was similar to or slightly warmer than at present. The age of these periods is not clear. It is suggested that the elder ice free interval is older than isotope stage 5e. The younger ice free interval could be of Eemian or Early Weichselian age. The uppermost succession of sublittoral-littoral sediments is of early Holocene age. It relates to the high (?100 m) postglacial marine limit, dated to approximately 10,000 bp.},

A 14C age determination shows that it is older than 45 Ky (kilo-years), and an age determination with infrared-stimulated luminescence---together with the stratigraphic position of the bone---suggests that it is of Eemian--Early Weichselian age: 130--110 Ky old. This makes the find the oldest remains of a polar bear ever discovered. Morphological analyses of the mandible suggest that it comes from a fully grown male that was similar in size to extant male polar bears. The comparative study of other available subfossil polar bear remains did not reveal any significant change in size of polar bears during the Late Quaternary.},

Lomonosovfonna may be less sensitive to such changes and primarily record atmospheric changes due to its higher elevation. The anthropogenic influence on Svalbard environment is illustrated by increased levels of non-sea-salt sulphate, nitrate, acidity, fly-ash and organic contaminants particularly during the second half of 1900s. Decreased concentrations of some components in recent decades most likely reflect emission and use restrictions.

  abstract     = {Ice cores from the relatively low-lying ice caps in Svalbard have not been widely exploited in climatic studies owing to uncertainties about the effect of meltwater percolation. However, results from two new Svalbard ice cores, at Lomonosovfonna and Austfonna, have shown that with careful site selection, high-resolution sampling and multiple chemical analyses it is possible to recover ice cores from which part of the annual signals are preserved, despite the considerable meltwater percolation. The new Svalbard ice cores are positioned in different parts of Svalbard and cover the past 800 years. In this paper we focus on the last 400 years. The 6180 signals from the cores are qualitatively similar over most of the twentieth century, suggesting that they record the same atmospheric signal. Prior to AD 1920, the Austfonna ice core exhibits more negative 6180 values than Lomonosovfonna, although there are intermittent decadal-scale periods throughout the record with similar values. We suggest that the differences reflect the effect of the inversion layer during the winter. The pattern in the 6180 records is similar to the Longyearbyen airtemperature record, but on an annual level the correlation is low. The Austfonna record correlates well with the temperature record from the more distant and southwesterly located Jan Mayen. A comparison of the ice-core and sea-ice records from this period suggests that sea-ice extent and Austfonna 6180 are related over the past 400 years. This may reflect the position of the storm tracks and their direct influence on the relatively low-altitude Austfonna. Lomonosovfonna may be less sensitive to such changes and primarily record free atmospheric changes instead of variations in sea-ice extent, the latter is probably a result of its higher elevation.},

Radar measurements indicate an ice depth of 126.5 m, and borehole temperature measurements show that the ice is below the melting point. High-resolution sampling of major ions, oxygen isotopes and deuterium has been performed on the core, and the results from the uppermost 36 m suggest that quasi-annual signals are preserved. The 1963 radioactive layer is situated at 18.5-18.95 m, giving a mean annual accumulation of 0.36 m w.e. for the period 1963-96. The upper 36 m of the ice core was dated back to 1920 by counting layers provided by the seasonal variations of the ions in addition to using a constant accumulation rate, with thinning by pure shear according to Nye (1963). The stratigraphy does not seem to have been obliterated by meltwater percolation, in contrast to most previous core sites on Svalbard. The anthropogenic influence on the Svalbard environment is illustrated by increased levels of sulphate, nitrate and acidity. Both nitrate and sulphate levels started to increase in the late 1940s, remained high until the late 1980s and have decreased during the last 15 years. The records of $\delta$18O, MSA (methane-sulphonic acid), and melt features along the core agree with the temperature record from Longyearbyen and the sea-ice record from the Barents Sea at a multi-year resolution, suggesting that this ice core reflects local climatic conditions.},

  abstract     = {The Gschnitz stadial was a period of regionally extensive glacier advance in the European Alps that lies temporally between the breakdown of the Last Glacial Maximum piedmont lobes and the beginning of the B{\o}lling warm interval. Moraines of the Gschnitz stadial are found in medium to small catchments, are steep-walled and blocky, and reflect a snowline lowering of 650-- 700m in comparison to the Little Ice Age reference snowline. 10Be surface exposure dating of boulders from the moraine at the type locality at Trins (Gschnitz valley, Tyrol, Austria) shows that it stabilised no later than 15 400+-1400 yr ago. The overall morphological situation and the long reaction time of the glacier suggest that the climatic downturn lasted about 500+-300yr, indicating that the Gschnitz cold period began approximately 15000+-1400yr ago, if not somewhat earlier. This is consistent with published radiocarbon dates that imply that the stadial occurred sometime between 15400 14Cyr BP (18020--19 100 cal. yr) and 13250 14Cyr BP (1 360--16015 cal. yr). A palaeoclimatic interpretation of the Gschnitz glacier based on a simple glacier flow model and statistical glacier-climate models shows that precipitation was about one-third of modern-day precipitation and summer temperatures were about 10K lower than today. In comparison, during the Younger Dryas, precipitation in this area was only about 10{\%} less and Ts (summer temperature) was only 3.5--4K lower than modern values. Based on the age of the moraine and the cold and dry climate at that time, we suggest that the Gschnitz stadial was the response of Alpine glaciers to cooling of the North Atlantic Ocean associated with Heinrich Event 1.},

  abstract     = {In the Alps, climatic conditions reflected in glacier and rock glacier activity in the earliest Holocene show a strong affinity to conditions in the latest Pleistocene (Younger Dryas). Glacier advances in the Alps related to Younger Dryas cooling led to the deposition of Egesen stadial moraines. Egesen stadial moraines can be divided into three or in some cases even more phases (sub-stadials). Moraines of the earliest and most extended advance, the Egesen maximum, stabilized at 12.2 $\pm$ 1.0 ka based on 10Be exposure dating at the Sch{\"{o}}nferwall (Tyrol, Austria) and the Julier Pass-outer moraine (Switzerland). Final stabilization of moraines at the end of the Egesen stadial was at 11.3 $\pm$ 0.9 ka as shown by 10Be data from four sites across the Alps. From west to east the sites are Piano del Praiet (northwestern Italy), Grosser Aletschgletscher (central Switzerland), Julier Pass-inner moraine (eastern Switzerland), and Val Viola (northeastern Italy). There is excellent agreement of the 10Be ages from the four sites. In the earliest Holocene, glaciers in the northernmost mountain ranges advanced at around 10.8 $\pm$ 1.1 ka as shown by 10Be data from the Kartell site (northern Tyrol, Austria). In more sheltered, drier regions rock glacier activity dominated as shown, for example, at Julier Pass and Larstig valley (Tyrol, Austria). New 10Be dates presented here for two rock glaciers in Larstig valley indicate final stabilization no later than 10.5 $\pm$ 0.8 ka. Based on this data, we conclude the earliest Holocene (between 11.6 and about 10.5 ka) was still strongly affected by the cold climatic conditions of the Younger Dryas and the Preboreal oscillation, with the intervening warming phase having had the effect of rapid downwasting of Egesen glaciers. At or slightly before 10.5 ka rapid shrinkage of glaciers to a size smaller than their late 20\textsuperscript{th} century size reflects markedly warmer and possibly also drier climate. Between about 10.5 ka and 3.3 ka conditions in the Alps were not conducive to significant glacier expansion except possibly during rare brief intervals. Past tree-line data from Kaunertal (Tyrol, Austria) in concert with radiocarbon and dendrochronologically dated wood fragments found recently in the glacier forefields in both the Swiss and Austrian Alps points to long periods during the Holocene when glaciers were smaller than they were during the late 20\textsuperscript{th} century. Equilibrium line altitudes (ELA) were about 200 m higher than they are today and about 300 m higher in comparison to Little Ice Age (LIA) ELAs. The Larstig rock glacier site we dated with 10Be is the type area for a postulated mid-Holocene cold period called the Larstig oscillation (presumed age about 7.0 ka). Our data point to final stabilization of those rock glaciers in the earliest Holocene and not in the middle Holocene. The combined data indicate there was no time window in the middle Holocene long enough for rock glaciers of the size and at the elevation of the Larstig site to have formed. During the short infrequent cold oscillations between 10.5 and 3.3 ka small glaciers (less than several km2) may have advanced to close to their LIA dimensions. Overall, the cold periods were just too short for large glaciers to advance. After 3.3 ka, climate conditions became generally colder and warm periods were brief and less frequent. Large glaciers (for example Grosser Aletschgletscher) advanced markedly at 3.0-2.6 ka, around 600 AD and during the LIA. Glaciers in the Alps attained their LIA maximum extents in the 14\textsuperscript{th}, 17\textsuperscript{th}, and 19\textsuperscript{th} centuries, with most reaching their greatest LIA extent in the final 1850/1860 AD advance. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

At the Early Lateglacial Gschnitz site (Trins, Austria), a 3000 yr spread in 10Be exposure ages points to prolonged boulder instability. Three out of seven ages are not included in the mean age calculation, which yielded 15,400??1000 yr (indistinguishable from the oldest boulder age of 16,130??1040 yr). As a result of the distinctive morphology at Julier Pass (Switzerland) site we are able to exposure date the early (12,300??1300 yr) and the late (11,300??600 yr) Egesen stadial glacier advances (Younger Dryas equivalent), not just final retreat. At the Kromer site (Austria), 10Be exposure ages from five clast-supported boulders are indistinguishable within the analytical uncertainties (mean age: 8400??500 yr). In addition to moraine age, key factors that may lead to "too young" ages include degree of matrix- vs. clast-support of the boulders, post-depositional periglacial activity and tree coverage. At the N??gelisgr??tli bedrock site near Grimsel Pass (Switzerland) exposure ages of 10,760-11,720 yr are consistent with Early Holocene cirque glacier retreat, and underline the marked lack of nuclide inheritance in bedrock exposures in the Alps. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.},

The detailed sinuosity of these first-order conjugate features matches perfectly, suggesting that they are the signature of the initial continental breakup and mark the ocean-continent boundary. Another weaker, still clearly deciphered, pair of symmetrical gravity anomalies is identified oceanward. These anomalies are considered as pseudo-isochrons F and G and tentatively dated 128 and 94. Ma. Precise reconstructions of pseudo-isochron F are achieved over three sections of the margin, denoting the relative motion of Australia and East Antarctica, the Polda Block and East Antarctica, and Tasmania and West Antarctica. The Polda Block and Tasmania are transient micro-continents. Tasmania and Australia are reconstructed to align their linear eastern margin. The eastern margins of reconstructed Australia, Tasmania, and West Antarctica on one hand, the western margin of reconstructed Lord Howe Rise and Campbell Plateau on the other hand, fit a small circle of radius 15??, which suggests a transform motion between 128 and 83. Ma along this plate boundary. The reconstruction predicts a gap between East and West Antarctica, probably filled by non-cratonic continental crust compressively deformed and thickened by the SW motion of East Antarctica and participating to the formation of the Trans-Antarctic Mountains. The initial extension between Australia and East Antarctica may be related to the inception of the Kerguelen hotspot, {\~{}}. 1000. km to the west. The different rheology of cratons and orogenic terranes has played a role in the style and localization of both extensional and compressional deformations.},

  abstract  = {New SHRIMP zircon data from Gjelsvikfjella and M??hlig-Hofmann-Gebirge indicate that the metamorphic basement is composed of Grenville-age rocks that are most likely part of the northeastern continuation of the Namaqua-Natal-Maud Belt. High-grade overprinting occurred between c. 560 and 490 Ma. This period is considered to bracket the collision of E- and W-Gondwana along the East African/Antarctic Orogen (EAAO) and also the subsequent collapse of the orogen. The onset of collision probably predates our oldest dates. We can clearly differentiate between an early compressional stage (Pan-African I) and a later dilational episode (Pan-African II). The Pan-African I event is characterised by the intrusion of leucogranites, and the formation of medium-U metamorphic zircon overgrowth. A sample of a syn-tectonic leucogranite gave a well-constrained crystallisation age of 558.4 ?? 5.6 Ma. These rocks are intensely deformed and have formed a second gt-bearing leucosome after their emplacement. Identical ages come from low-U metamorphic zircons and low-U rims from another leucosome at Festninga (557 ?? 13 Ma). The Pan-African II event (c. 530 and 490 Ma) is characterised by widespread melting and only little deformation. It is associated with charnockite magmatism, charnockitisation and high-temperature metamorphism. Wide, very high-U zircon rims form during this period. The early Pan-African II overprint between c. 530 and 520 Ma is recorded in almost all samples. An undeformed mafic dyke with a zircon crystallisation age of 523.2 ?? 4.8 indicates that there is no or minor deformation after its intrusion. This strongly metasomatised dyke, however, also indicates that although deformation ceased, intense fluid circulation continued. The youngest crystallisation ages come from a post-tectonic granite sheet which yields a crystallisation age of 486.9 ?? 3.8 Ma. Final cooling to temperatures below c. 600 ??C is recorded by a titanite age of c. 483 ?? 11 Ma from the Stabben gabbro. Late to post-tectonic granitoids are voluminous and intrude over a period of c. 30 Ma, between c. 520 and 490 Ma. They are alkaline in composition and can be classified as A2-type. This indicates that they are probably formed by melting of a tonalitic to granodioritic lower crust in the cause of crustal thickening, or from underplated lower crust. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we review the dimensions, geometry and architecture of the components of the Kalahari Craton and the various positions this important crustal block could have occupied within Rodinia. The Kalahari Craton was spawned from a small composite Archaean core which grew by prolonged crustal accretion in the Palaeoproterozoic along its NW side (Magondi-Okwa-Kheis Belt, Rehoboth Subprovince) to form the Proto-Kalahari Craton by 1750 Ma. From ca. 1400 to 1000 Ma, all margins of this crustal entity recorded intense tectonic activity: the NW margin was a major active continental margin between ca. 1400 and 1200 Ma and along the southern and eastern margins, the Namaqua-Natal-Maud-Mozambique Belt records a major arc-accretion and continent-collision event between ca. 1100 and 1050 Ma. By ca. 1050 Ma, the Proto-Kalahari nucleus was almost completely rimmed by voluminous Mesoproterozoic crust and became a larger entity, the Kalahari Craton. Apart from southern Africa, fragments of the Kalahari Craton are now exposed in East- and West-Antarctica, the Falkland Islands and possibly also in South America. Immediately prior to the onset of arc- and continent-continent collision along the Namaqua-Natal-Maud Belt (part of the widespread "Grenville-age" orogeny during which Rodinia was assembled), Kalahari was subjected to intraplate magmatism - the Umkondo-Borg Large Igneous Province - at ca. 1110 Ma. The post-Rodinia rift and drift history of the Kalahari Craton is best preserved along the western, south-western and north-western margin, where rift sediments and volcanics indicate rifting and break-up at ca. 800-750 Ma. The position of the Kalahari Craton in Rodinia is problematic, and there is no unique solution for its placement in the supercontinent. One set of models has the Kalahari Craton lying along the SW side of Laurentia with the Namaqua-Natal-Maud Belt facing either inboard (correlation with the Ottawan cycle of the Grenville orogen) or outboard (mainly for palaeomagnetic reasons). In this arrangement the relatively late rift history and the subsequent incorporation of Kalahari into Gondwana is problematic. Alternatively, Kalahari could have been attached to Western Australia. In this model the Namaqua-Natal-Maud Belt has no counterpart and, although the timing of rifting at ca. 750 Ma fits, the location of rifting is problematic-the Kalahari Craton would have had to undergo major rifting along its eastern, rather than its western side, which is not consistent with overservations. So the matter is as yet unresolved, and much of the evidence of rifting along the eastern side of the Kalahari Craton was obliterated due to high-grade overprint along the Late Neoproterozoic/Early Palaeozoic East African-Antarctic Orogen. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Here we aim to provide a step in this direction by presenting an overview of Arctic Ocean glacial history, based on the present state-of-the-art knowledge gained from field work and chronological studies, and with a specific focus on ice-sheet extent and environmental conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The maximum Quaternary extension of ice sheets is discussed and compared to LGM. We bring together recent results from the circum-Arctic continental margins and the deep central basin; extent of ice sheets and ice streams bordering the Arctic Ocean as well as evidence for ice shelves extending into the central deep basin. Discrepancies between new results and published LGM ice-sheet reconstructions in the high Arctic are highlighted and outstanding questions are identified. Finally, we address the ability to simulate the Arctic Ocean ice sheet complexes and their dynamics, including ice streams and ice shelves, using presently available ice-sheet models. Our review shows that while we are able to firmly reject some of the earlier hypotheses formulated to describe Arctic Ocean glacial conditions, we still lack information from key areas to compile the holistic Arctic Ocean glacial history. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

  abstract     = {Deep-water formation in the northern North Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic Ocean is a key driver of the global thermohaline circulation and hence also of global climate. Deciphering the history of the circulation regime in the Arctic Ocean has long been prevented by the lack of data from cores of Cenozoic sediments from the Arctic's deep-sea floor. Similarly, the timing of the opening of a connection between the northern North Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean, permitting deep-water exchange, has been poorly constrained. This situation changed when the first drill cores were recovered from the central Arctic Ocean. Here we use these cores to show that the transition from poorly oxygenated to fully oxygenated ('ventilated') conditions in the Arctic Ocean occurred during the later part of early Miocene times. We attribute this pronounced change in ventilation regime to the opening of the Fram Strait. A palaeo-geographic and palaeo-bathymetric reconstruction of the Arctic Ocean, together with a physical oceanographic analysis of the evolving strait and sill conditions in the Fram Strait, suggests that the Arctic Ocean went from an oxygen-poor 'lake stage', to a transitional 'estuarine sea' phase with variable ventilation, and finally to the fully ventilated 'ocean' phase 17.5 Myr ago. The timing of this palaeo-oceanographic change coincides with the onset of the middle Miocene climatic optimum, although it remains unclear if there is a causal relationship between these two events.},

The data show parallel, glacially induced seafloor scours, or grooves, and intervening ridges that reach widths of 1000 m (rim to rim) and as much as 40 m relief. Following previous authors, we refer to these features as "megascale glacial lineations (MSGLs)." Additional support for ice grounding is apparent from stratigraphic unconformities, interpreted to have been caused by ice-induced erosion. Most likely, the observed sea-floor features represent evidence for massive ice-shelf grounding. The general ESE/WNW direction of the MSGLs, together with sediment, evidently bulldozed off the Chukchi Plateau, that is mapped on the western (Siberian) side of the plateau, suggests ice flow from the Canada Basin side of Chukchi Borderland. Two separate generations of glacially derived MSGLs are identified on the Chukchi Borderland from the Healy geophysical data. The deepest and oldest extensive MSGLs appear to be draped by sediments less than 5 m thick, whereas no sediment drape can be distinguished within the resolution of the sub-bottom profiles on the younger generation. ?? 2005 University of Washington.

Correlation of this Mn and color chronology to established apparent Brunhes-age estimates of geomagnetic excursions reveals a remarkable fit between these two independently derived time scales. The Mn and color cycles probably provide paleoenvironmental information about material fluxes in the Arctic Ocean over the past 1 m.y. We suggest that the primary source for the observed manganese variations in our sediment core is northern Siberia, which has extensive peat bogs and boreal forests. These Siberian source areas could operate in an off and on mode tuned to Pleistocene glacial and interglacial periods. Contrasts in ventilation of Arctic Ocean waters during interglacial-glacial cycles probably could also enhance the observed Mn and color variability.},

Each of these mechanisms could play a role in compensating topography on Venus, and we distinguish between these mechanisms in part by calculating geoid-to-topography ratios and apparent depths of compensation. By simultaneously inverting for mass anomalies at two depths, we solve for the spatial distribution of crustal thickness and a similar map of mass anomalies in the mantle, thus separating the effects of shallow and deep compensation mechanisms on the geoid. The roughly circular regions of mantle mass deficit coincide with the locations of what are commonly interpreted to be buoyant mantle plumes. Additionally, there is a significant geographic correlation between patches of thickened crust and mass deficits in the mantle, especially for spherical harmonic degree l {\textless} 40. These mass deficits may be interpreted either as lateral thermal variations or as Mg-rich melt residuum. The magnitudes of mass deficits under the crustal highlands are roughly consistent with a paradigm in which highland crust is produced by melting of upwelling plumes. The mean thickness of the crust is constrained to a range of 8--25 km, somewhat lower than previous estimates. The best two-layered inversion of gravity incorporates a dynamic mantle load at a depth of 250 km.},

We identify different stages of continental glaciation and model the erosion processes associated with each stage. The model links erosion to the basal thermal regime and indicates that much of the Antarctic interior may have been subject to less than 200. m of erosion. The depth of erosion reflects the presence or absence of warm-based ice and the consistency of ice flow direction. This information, linked with knowledge about landscapes of glaciation in the northern hemisphere and some simple but robust assumptions about initial topography, is used to generate a map of the subglacial Antarctic landscape in which much of the lowland interior resembles the landscapes of areal scouring typical of the Laurentian and Scandinavian shields. Near the continental margins selective linear erosion has overdeepened pre-existing river valleys by as much as 2.8. km. High elevation plateaus adjacent to such drainage systems have survived largely unmodified under cold-based ice. High erosion rates result from steep thermal gradients in basal ice. Mountain regions such as the Gamburtsev Mountains, uplands in Dronning Maud Land and massifs in West Antarctica are likely to bear features of local alpine glaciation. Such landscapes may have been protected under cold-based ice for the last 34. Myrs or possibly longer. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

High-resolution micro-drilling techniques have allowed detailed stable isotope profiles to be obtained from selected travertine cross-sections. The data reflect seasonal fluctuations in temperatures during travertine growth and constrain the travertine growth rate. Most of the travertine growth occurs during the summer season as most of the flooded travertine pools were probably frozen for about 6 months per year. Oxygen isotope variations among the travertine terraces partly reflect fluctuations in the spring source composition.

  abstract     = {There appear to have been at least two significant episodes of uplift around the North Atlantic during the Cenozoic, and in many places it is not easy to separate the two. Effects related to emplacement of the Iceland plume probably caused one episode, mostly in the Palaeogene. The second episode took place in the late Cenozoic, and comprised uplift of basin margins as well as accelerated subsidence of basin centres adjacent to the uplifted landmasses. Cenozoic uplift of Scandinavia and of the British Isles has been suggested since at least the beginning of the 20\textsuperscript{th} century. However, it is only recently being recognised in the literature that a major Neogene tectonic event has affected nearly every continental margin in the area (including western and eastern Greenland) and far into the European craton. Pre-Cenozoic rocks are generally exposed onshore and the pre-Quaternary sediments offshore are generally of Neogene age. Between the two, inclined Palaeogene and older beds are truncated by erosional unconformities along many coastlines. This structural configuration is in accordance with a Neogene uplift of the continents. A variety of methods have been used to investigate uplift, erosion and redeposition: studies of maximum burial, fission tracks, geomorphology, sediment supply and structural relations. These methods each investigates only one aspect of the phenomenon, and a thorough understanding of the processes of uplift and erosion can only be achieved if results from these methods are integrated. The main mechanisms suggested in the literature for the large-scale, late Cenozoic events are: emplacement of magma in and at the base of the crust leading to isostatic uplift, flow of asthenospheric material into active diapirs, isostacy associated with glacial erosion, phase changes in the lithosphere due to pressure relief and regional compression of the lithosphere. It is premature to judge between these mechanisms because of the insufficient regional analyses carried out so far. A general model must be constrained by observations from all affected areas, it must separate the effects of Palaeogene uplift from those of Neogene uplift that reach beyond the passive margins, and also include the subsidence patterns observed adjacent to the landmasses.

  abstract     = {We compare heat flow data from the Precambrian shields in North America and in South Africa. We also review data available in other less well-sampled Shield regions. Variations in crustal heat production account for most of the variability of the heat flow. Because of this variability, it is difficult to define a single average crustal model representative of a whole tectonic province. The average heat flow values of different Archean provinces in Canada, South Africa, Australia and India differ by significant amounts. This is also true for Proterozoic provinces. For example, the heat flow is significantly higher in the Proterozoic Namaqua-Natal Belt of South Africa than in the Grenville Province of the Canadian Shield (61 vs. 41 mW m???2 on average). These observations indicate that it is not possible to define single value of the average heat flow for all provinces of the same crustal age. Large amplitude short wavelength variations of the heat flow suggest that most of the difference between Proterozoic and Archean heat flow is of crustal origin. In eastern Canada, there is no good correlation between the local values of heat flow and heat production. In the Archean, Proterozoic and Paleozoic provinces of eastern Canada, heat flow values through rocks with the same heat production are not significantly different. There is therefore no evidence for variations of the mantle heat flow beneath these different provinces. After removing the local crustal heat production from the surface heat flow, the mantle (Moho) heat flow was estimated to be between 10-15 mW m-2 in the Archean, Proterozoic and Paleozoic provinces of eastern Canada. Estimates of the mantle heat flow in the Kaapvaal craton of South Africa may be slightly higher (???17 mW m-2). Large-scale variations of bulk crustal heat production are well-documented in Canada and imply significant differences of deep lithospheric thermal structure. In thick lithosphere, surficial heat flow measurements record a time average of heat production in the lithospheric mantle and are not in equilibrium with the instantaneous heat production. The low mantle heat flow and current estimates of heat production in the lithospheric mantle do not support a mechanical (conductive) lithosphere thinner than 200 km and thicker than 330 km. Temperature anomalies with surrounding oceanic mantle extend to the convective boundary layer below the conductive layer, and hence to depths greater than these estimates. Mechanical and thermal stability of the lithosphere require the mantle part of the lithosphere to be chemically buoyant and depleted in radiogenic elements. Both characteristics are achieved simultaneously by partial melting and melt extraction. ?? 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {We present evidence for freshwater forcing from the Greenland Ice Sheet during the last deglaciation, explore its potential involvement in the Younger Dryas cooling, and investigate the role of Atlantic Intermediate Water in the retreat of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Paleoceanographic conditions and ice-sheet retreat history are interpreted from IRD, stable isotopes and foraminiferal assemblages in sediment cores retrieved along the length of the Kangerlussuaq Trough, a cross-shelf trough on the southeast Greenland shelf. The Vedde Ash (11,980$\pm$cal. yr BP), which is a marker bed within the Younger Dryas, and the Saksunarvatn tephra (10,180$\pm$cal. yr BP) an early Holocene marker horizon, have been located in these cores. The tephra markers and calibrated 14C dates on foraminifers and molluscs provide the basis for the age models in the cores. The stable isotope records indicate a 0.5 {\textperthousand} depletion of the 18O between 13.4 and 12.8 cal ka BP. A pronounced light isotope event, exceeding 1.5 {\textperthousand} on the inner shelf and 0.8 {\textperthousand} on the outer shelf, occurs at the beginning of the Younger Dryas Cold period (12.8 cal. ka BP) and ends by 12 cal ka BP, immediately before deposition of the Vedde Ash. The light isotope spikes are interpreted as glacial meltwater spikes associated with retreat of the adjacent Greenland Ice Sheet. Associated with the light isotope events are episodic high percentages of the Atlantic Intermediate Water benthic foraminiferal species, Cassidulina neoteretis, which continue from the B{\o}lling/Aller{\o}d into the Younger Dryas. High percentages of this species suggest that Atlantic Intermediate Water entered the Kangerlussuaq Trough during the Aller{\o}d and the Younger Dryas via the Irminger Current, as it does today. We conclude that advection of Atlantic Intermediate Water into the Kangerlussuaq Trough, south of the Denmark Strait, promoted melting and retreat of the marine portions of the Greenland Ice Sheet, explaining the observed glacial meltwater spikes. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract     = {This study investigates the subglacial sedimentary archive at Tschierva Glacier, Eastern Swiss Alps. Subfossil wood remains found at the retreating glacier tongue indicate that their emergence results from recent transport from an upvalley basin. A confluence-basin-like structure was found to exist by georadar measurements underneath the present glacier. In combination with high resolution age determinations based on dendrochronology and radiocarbon dating it is implied that a retreated Tschierva Glacier allowed vegetation growth and sediment accumulation in that basin. Three periods of glacier recession were detected, which occurred around 9200 cal yr BP, from 7450 to 6650 cal yr BP and from 6200 to 5650 cal yr BP. These periods are called Holocene optimum events (HOE). Accordingly, an equilibrium line rise {\textgreater}220 m compared to the reference period from 1960 to 1985 was inferred from digital elevation models of former glacier extents. Since glacier mass balance depends on summer (June-July-August) temperature and precipitation, an equilibrium line altitude (ELA) rise of 220 m implies a summer temperature increase of about 1.8 {$^{\circ}$}C assuming unchanged precipitation during the dated HOE. Alternative calculations point to probable temperature increase in a broad interval between +1.0 {$^{\circ}$}C taking into account a precipitation change of -250 mm/a to +2.5 {$^{\circ}$}C with +250 mm/a precipitation change, supporting earlier paleotemperature estimates. It is proposed that higher mean summer insolation caused a stronger seasonality during the mid-Holocene as compared to late Holocene conditions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

An extended data set of Swiss glacier recessions consisting of 143 radiocarbon dates is presented to improve the chronology of glacier fluctuations. A comparison with other archives and dated glacier advances suggests 12 major recession periods occurring at 9850-9600, 9300-8650, 8550-8050, 7700-7550, 7450-6550, 6150-5950, 5700-5500, 5200-4400, 4300-3400, 2800-2700, 2150-1850, 1400-1200 cal. yr BP. It is proposed that major glacier fluctuations occurred on a multicentennial scale with a changing pattern during the course of the Holocene. After the Younger Dryas, glaciers receded to a smaller extent and prolonged recessions occurred repeatedly, culminating around 7 cal. kyr BP. After a transition around 6 cal. kyr BP weak fluctuations around the present level dominated. After 3.6 cal. kyr BP less frequent recessions interrupted the trend to advanced glaciers peaking with the prominent 'Little Ice Age'. This trend is in line with a continuous decrease of summer insolation during the Holocene. Articles that cite this article?},

Deformation, metamorphism and crustal anatectic magmatism occurred both during the Grenvillian (960--940 Ma) and Caledonian (450--410 Ma) orogenies. This evolution shows great similarities with that of eastern Greenland. In the classical model, eastern Svalbard is placed outboard of central east Greenland in pre-Caledonian time. Alternatively, it may have been located north-east of Greenland and transferred west and rotated anticlockwise during Caledonian continent--continent collision. In the Neoproterozoic, easternmost Svalbard may have been part of a wider area of Grenville-age crust, now fragmented and dispersed around the Arctic.},

This suggests that the dominant influence on oxygen isotope variations reflected in the ice-sheet records was regional climatic change. Differences in detail between the records probably reflect the effects of basal deformation in the ice as well as geographical gradients in atmospheric isotope ratios. Palaeotemperature estimates have been obtained from the records using three approaches: (i) inferences based on the measured relationship between mean annual $\delta$18O of snow and of mean annual surface temperature over Greenland; (ii) modelled inversion of the borehole temperature profile constrained either by the dated isotopic profile, or (iii) by using Monte Carlo simulation techniques. The third of these approaches was adopted to reconstruct Holocene temperature variations for the Dye 3 and GRIP temperature profiles, which yields remarkably compatible results. A new record of Holocene isotope variations obtained from the NorthGRIP ice-core matches the GRIP short-term isotope record, and also shows similar long-term trends to the Dye-3 and GRIP inverted temperature data. The NorthGRIP isotope record reflects: (i) a generally stronger isotopic signal than is found in the GRIP record; (ii) several short-lived temperature fluctuations during the first 1500 yr of the Holocene; (iii) a marked cold event at ca. 8.2 ka (the {\textquoteleft}8.2 ka event'); (iv) optimum temperatures for the Holocene between ca. 8.6 and 4.3 ka, a signal that is 0.6{\textperthousand} stronger than for the GRIP profile; (v) a clear signal for the Little Ice Age; and (vi) a clear signal of climate warming during the last century. These data suggest that the NorthGRIP stable isotope record responded in a sensitive manner to temperature fluctuations during the Holocene.

  abstract     = {The Mesozoic opening history of the Southern Ocean between South America, Africa, and Antarctica is one of the largest gaps in knowledge on the evolution of this region. Competing geodynamic models were published during the last two decades to explain the geophysical and geological observations. Here we report on aeromagnetic data collected along the East Antarctic coast during five seasons. These data provide new constraints on the timing and geometry of the early Gondwana breakup. In the Riiser-Larsen Sea/ Mozambique Basin, the first oceanic crust between Africa and Antarctica formed around 155 Ma. In the west the Weddell Rift propagated from west to east with a velocity of 63 km/Myr between chrons M19N and M17N. At chron M14N, South America and Africa finally were split off the Antarctic continent. Stretching in the area of the South Atlantic started at the latest from 155 Myr onward. The different spreading velocities and directions of South America and Africa created at chron M9N the first oceanic crust in the South Atlantic. A new model indicates that the Karoo and Dronning Maud Land magmatism occurred well before any new ocean floor was created and therefore the first formation of new oceanic crust cannot directly be related to a plume interaction.},

  abstract     = {Explosive degassing at Erebus Volcano produces infrasound that can be used to locate, characterize, and quantify eruptive activity from multiple vents. We use a three element distributed microphone network to pinpoint eruption sources and track the activity at the prominent vents through time. Eruptive mechanisms for both source types are analyzed in conjunction with the telemetered time-synced video imagery. We identify two commonly active vents corresponding to the large (often {\textgreater} 10-m diameter) bubble bursts at the free surface of a persistent phonolitic lava lake ('Ray Lake'), and the less frequent ash-rich eruptions from a constricted vent ('Active Vent') located ??? 80??m from the lava lake. During a 3-month study interval from 6 January to 13 April 2006 we identified and mapped more than 350 eruptive sources from the lava lake and 20 sources from the ash vent. Lava lake events are characterized by high-amplitude infrasonic transients that reflect rapid (less than a few s) acceleration and rupture of magma bubble films followed by an explosion of pressurized gases. Precise infrasonic localization of the lava lake events to accuracies of a few m indicates variable bubble source locations across a 40 by 50-m region spanning the lava lake. Spatial variability is corroborated by the video data. In contrast, degassing from the ash vent produces longer-duration (tens of s), lower amplitude transients that reflect diminished impulsivity and an extended degassing duration, features that are corroborated by video. Because infrasound networks can operate continuously in all weather conditions and during both diurnal and seasonal polar darkness, and are easily incorporated into automatic processing, they significantly contribute to the completeness and quantification of eruption catalogues for Erebus. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {The Wilkes Subglacial Basin, in the hinterland of the Transantarctic Mountains, represents one of the least understood continental-scale features in Antarctica. Aeromagnetic data suggests that this basin may be imposed on a Ross age back arc region adjacent to the East Antarctic Craton. However, the evolution of the deeper crustal structure is disputed. Here, we present new airborne gravity data that reveals the crustal architecture of the northern Wilkes Subglacial Basin. Our gravity models indicate that the crust under the northern Wilkes Subglacial Basin is 30-35. km thick, i.e. ca 5-10. km thinner than imaged under the Transantarctic Mountains, and {\~{}}. 15. km thinner than predicted from some flexural and seismic models in the southern Wilkes Basin. We suggest that crustal thickening under northern Victoria Land reflects Ross-age (ca 500. Ma) orogenic events. Airy isostatic anomalies along both flanks of the Wilkes Basin reveal major inherited tectonic structures, which likely controlled the basin location, supporting aeromagnetic interpretations of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin as a structurally controlled basin. The positive anomaly along the western margin of the basin defines the boundary between the East Antarctic Craton and the Ross Orogen, and the anomaly along its eastern flank likely reflects high-grade rocks of the central Wilson Terrane. Our models indicate that the crust is {\~{}}. 5. km thinner beneath the northern Wilkes Basin, compared to formerly contiguous segments of the Delamerian Orogen in south-eastern Australia. The thinner crust may be linked to: i) back-arc basin formation or orogenic collapse processes and segmentation within the Ross$\backslash$Delamerian Orogen, ii) Jurassic to Cretaceous extension prior to break-up between Australia and East Antarctica, iii) Cenozoic glacial erosion or most likely, iv) a combination of these processes. ?? 2012.},

This datum and the pure path dispersion data make it necessary to invoke significant differences between continental and oceanic shear velocity structures to depths exceeding 400 km. An analysis of the constraints on thermal profiles, including the constraints recently established by empirical geothermometry, indicates that temperature differences between the ancient shields and the ocean basins also extend deep into the mantle, with shields characterized by thermal gradients that are superadiabatic above 400 km. To at least 400-km depth beneath shields the dominant mechanism of heat transport is conduction, not advection. It is concluded that this entire region, termed here the continental tectosphere, translates coherently during lateral plate motions. It is proposed that the superadiabatic vertical temperature gradients beneath shields and the horizontal temperature gradients within the transition from shield to oceanic structures are stabilized by compositional gradients, the subcontinental mantle consisting of intrinsically less dense material. The existence of deep continental structure is apparently consistent with the dynamics of plate motions. It suggests that convection is not confined to the earth's upper mantle.},

  abstract     = {We have produced a map of velocity covering much of the Siple Coast ice streams. The map confirms earlier estimates of deceleration on Whillans Ice Stream. Comparison with bed elevation data indicates that subglacial topography and the location of consolidated sediment play a strong role in determining the location of the tributaries feeding the ice streams. Force balance estimates based on these data indicate that the tributaries have beds nearly an order of magnitude stronger than those beneath many of the ice streams. We have used a theoretical analysis to examine the controls on fast flow. This analysis suggests that ice plains (very wide ice streams) are inherently unstable. This instability may be responsible for the current deceleration on the Ice Plain of Whillans Ice Stream and the shutdown of Ice Stream C 150 years ago. Thinning-induced reductions indriving stress may also explain some of the observed deceleration, particularly in upstream areas. The active portions of Ice Stream C coincide well with the areas where we estimate that melt should be taking place. Current topography and inferences of large thickening following a shutdown suggest the upstream migration of a stagnation front that initiated at the ice plain. Uncertainty remains about the basal conditions on Ice Stream D, while the basal resistance on Ice Stream E is large enough to ensure basal melting.},

The samples span a latitudinal transect from 62 to 74 degreesN, reflecting climatic and vegetational gradients that range from low Arctic to transitional mid-Arctic to high Arctic. While the sampled lakes encompass both predominantly maritime and continental climatic regimes, sites have been deliberately restricted to basins in Precambrian crystalline terrain to mitigate the edaphic consequences of alkaline sedimentary bedrock. Canonical correspondence analysis, using forward selection and Monte Carlo permutation tests, identified pH, conductivity, summer lake water temperature, and mean annual air temperature as significant environmental controls over diatom assemblages. Using weighted-averaging regression and calibration, predictive models for these parameters have been developed. When applied to down-core assemblages, the summer lake water temperature model provides realistic reconstructions when compared with other paleoenvironmental records. Over the past 5000 years, the amplitude of reconstructed summer lake water temperature is on the order of 4.0 degreesC, expressed primarily as progressive Neoglacial cooling culminating in the Little Ice Age. Diatom-inferred summer water temperatures have increased by 2.0 degreesC in the past 150 years, again in agreement with independent paleoclimatic reconstructions.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the clay and heavy mineral analysis of ODP Site 911 sediments is used to investigate the sources and transport mechanisms (sea ice and oceanic currents) of sediments in the Arctic Ocean during the Mid to Late Pliocene (3.10-2.78 Myr) and upper Quaternary (800 kyr to the present). The time period between 3.10 and 3.00 Myr is characterized by a decreasing smectite and increasing illite content, which is interpreted as reflecting cooling conditions. At the beginning of the Mid-Pliocene Global Warmth period at similar to 3.00 Myr, the smectite content shows an abrupt increase. This change can also be seen as a drop in the amount of kaolinite and TOC. After 3.00 Myr the kaolinite and TOC values start to increase, probably indicating high rates of reworked glacially eroded matter. During the Pleistocene, smectite shows a lower and illite a higher fluctuation level compared with the Pliocene. This might be due to reigning glacial conditions during the Pleistocene, when the freshwater input was much lower than during the Pliocene. During the Pliocene, the fluctuating heavy minerals might reflect changes in freshwater input from the great Siberian rivers, which would have led to changes in the supply of terrigenous material delivered to the shelf by the rivers. The heavy mineral fluctuation also reflects changes in the amount of sea-ice formation, which correlates with climate variations and the freshwater input from the continent. Based on the composition of the clay and heavy mineral groups in this study, the most likely transportation path is the Siberian branch of the Transpolar Drift.},

  abstract     = {Modern remote sensing techniques can help in the assessment of permafrost hazards in high latitudes and cold mountains. Hazard development in these areas is affected by process interactions and chain reactions, the ongoing shift of cryospheric hazard zones due to atmospheric warming, the large spatial scales involved and the remoteness of many permafrost-related threats. This paper reviews ground-based, airborne and spaceborne remote sensing methods suitable for permafrost hazard assessment and management. A wide range of image classification and change detection techniques support permafrost hazard studies. Digital terrain models (DTMs) derived from optical stereo, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or laser scanning data are some of the most important data sets for investigating permafrost-related mass movements, thaw and heave processes, and hydrologcal hazards. Mulit-temporal optical or SAR data are used to derive surface displacements on creeping and unstable frozen slopes. Combining STMs with results from spectral image classification, and with multi-temporal data from change detection and displacement measurements significantly improves the detection of hazard potential.},

  abstract     = {Compared to the other islands in the Svalbard archipelago, Nordaustlandet offers only limited stratigraphical or sedimentological information on its Quaternary deposits. This article aims to fill the gap by presenting new results from glacial geological, sedimentological and chronological studies in the southern Murchisonfjorden area. Field data include reconnaissance mapping and detailed logging of vertical sections along cliff-face outcrops a few metres high adjacent to the present-day shoreline. Combined with OSL and AMS age determinations, these data provide evidence of three successive Weichselian sequences, each represented by the deposition of till followed by the accumulation of shallow marine deposits. Contrary to earlier conclusions, this study demonstrates that the area was occupied by a Late Weichselian glacier (LWG), although the LWG till is thin and discontinuous. Interstadial sublittoral sand related to the Mid-Weichselian interstadial was dated to 38--40{~}kyr, and an Early Weichselian interstadial to 76--80{~}kyr. The preservation of older sediments, multiple striae generations and abundant observations of weathered local bedrock material indicate weak glacial erosion within the study area. We suggest that the Late Weichselian glacier was relatively inactive and remained mainly cold-based until the deglaciation. The Isvika sections can be considered a new key site that offers further potential to improve our understanding of the Weichselian stage within the northwestern sector of the Barents--Kara Ice Sheet.},

Laminated layering around the crust-mantle boundary is well imaged using coherency enhancement processing after NMO corrections applied to far offset data.

The crustal density structure between L??tzow-Holm Bay (LHB) and the inland plateau was inferred from Bouguer gravity anomalies along these routes by assuming an initial model of the P-wave structure derived from seismic refraction surveys in the LHB. A decrease in the Bouguer anomalies down to - 200. mGal toward the inland plateau indicate that the crust thickens from 38-40. km at LHB to 48-50. km beneath Dome-F. During the International Polar Year in 2007-2008, the GAmburtsev Mountain SEISmic experiment (GAMSEIS) deployed many broadband stations over the large highland on the ice sheet from the crest of the Gambursev Subglacial Mountains (GSM) to the vicinity of Dome-F. S-wave receiver functions and Rayleigh phase velocities determined using the GAMSEIS data indicate that the cratonic crust surrounding the GSM is 40-47. km thick. These thickness estimates agree with those beneath Dome-F from the JARE's gravity surveys and are also consistent with average Pre-Cambrian terrains. Beneath the GSM, the crustal thickness increases to 55-58. km and has been interpreted as providing isostatic compensation for the high mountain elevations. Accordingly, a long-distance crustal model extending over 3000. km from LHB to Dome-F and to the GSM was compiled, providing significant information for future studies of the tectonic evolution of the Antarctic craton. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Two were bedrock surface samples from different parts of the island, one was from a local boulder. The samples were collected where former coverage by valley glaciers can be excluded. Especially, the bedrock surface samples were expected to provide new constraints for the chronology of glaciations on the island and on the arctic continental shelf in the Beringian region. Minimum exposure age estimates for these bedrock samples, calculated on the basis of 10Be concentrations, are 64,600 $\pm$ 6400 and 26,400 $\pm$ 2100 years. These estimates suggest that no major glaciations have affected Wrangel Island or the adjacent shelf area after 64,600 $\pm$ 6400 years. Specifically, these dates seem to rule out any major glaciation during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The estimates should however be regarded as preliminary, as only two bedrock surface samples were analysed, but are compatible with the absence of glacial morphology and sediments, and with radiocarbon dates from mammoth remains. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract     = {A major geologic boundary has been proposed in the Southern Rocky Mountains separating Proterozoic crustal provinces with different ages and tectonic histories. These provinces probably correlate with the Yavapai (1.8--1.7 Ga) and Mazatzal (1.7--1.6 Ga) provinces of Arizona. Geologic, geochemical, geochronologic, and xenolith data suggest that the boundary lies within a $\sim$300 km-wide zone that trends northeastward through southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. This zone also seems to have focused later tectonic and thermal effects. However, no major shear zone that might represent a discrete tectonic suture has been identified in the area, and there is no agreement on precisely where the boundary is or what tectonic significance it may have.We present a review of evidence supporting extrapolation of the Yavapai-Mazatzal boundary through the Southern Rocky Mountains. Limitations in the precision, quantity, and interpretation of available data probably contribute to disagreement over the location of the boundary. However, the disparity in boundaries defined by different data sets may partly reflect a complex or gradational transition between crustal domains. We propose a speculative model for the boundary based on a preliminary structural analysis. Tectonic fabrics appear to be consistent with the initial juxtaposition of arc terranes of the Yavapai and Mazatzal provinces on a low-angle thrust system with later modification and steepening of the boundary during continued crustal shortening. This model explains the diffuse isotopic boundary as a manifestation of a vertically heterogeneous crustal column that might promote isotopic mixing. The cryptic structural expression of the suture may result from a layer-parallel style of suturing and complex post-accretionary tectonic overprinting.},

In the current study we use electrical conductivity data of partially water saturated core plugs to determine the cementation factor, m. This value differs from the one Archie used to describe his equation and best describes the formation factor based on experimental data. Based on this m, we determine the formation factor, F, and the tortuosity, $\tau$. We use this value of $\tau$, to calculate permeability based on electrical resistivity data. We also calculate the permeability based on a simple porosity model. Finally, we redefine Kozeny's factor, c, using Carman's model based on tortuosity and the model based on porosity. This resulted in a third modelled permeability, which describes the experimental data in high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The spatio-temporal pattern of peak Holocene warmth (Holocene thermal maximum, HTM) is traced over 140 sites across the Western Hemisphere of the Arctic (0-180??W; north of ???60??N). Paleoclimate inferences based on a wide variety of proxy indicators provide clear evidence for warmer-than-present conditions at 120 of these sites. At the 16 terrestrial sites where quantitative estimates have been obtained, local HTM temperatures (primarily summer estimates) were on average 1.6??0.8??C higher than present (approximate average of the 20\textsuperscript{th} century), but the warming was time-transgressive across the western Arctic. As the precession-driven summer insolation anomaly peaked 12-10ka (thousands of calendar years ago), warming was concentrated in northwest North America, while cool conditions lingered in the northeast. Alaska and northwest Canada experienced the HTM between ca 11 and 9ka, about 4000yr prior to the HTM in northeast Canada. The delayed warming in Quebec and Labrador was linked to the residual Laurentide Ice Sheet, which chilled the region through its impact on surface energy balance and ocean circulation. The lingering ice also attests to the inherent asymmetry of atmospheric and oceanic circulation that predisposes the region to glaciation and modulates the pattern of climatic change. The spatial asymmetry of warming during the HTM resembles the pattern of warming observed in the Arctic over the last several decades. Although the two warmings are described at different temporal scales, and the HTM was additionally affected by the residual Laurentide ice, the similarities suggest there might be a preferred mode of variability in the atmospheric circulation that generates a recurrent pattern of warming under positive radiative forcing. Unlike the HTM, however, future warming will not be counterbalanced by the cooling effect of a residual North American ice sheet. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {Pleistocene glacial-estuarine sediment deposited in an intertidal environment of northeastern Bristol Bay, southwestern Alaska, was dated using a variety of approaches, including infrared stimulated and thermoluminescence (IRSL and TL) techniques. Analysis of modern and14C-dated Holocene tide-flat mud demonstrates that the bulk of sediment in this environment is reset by solar radiation, thereby lending confidence to ages obtained from similar Pleistocene deposits by luminescence techniques. IRSL seems to be especially well suited for dating, with resolution on time scales of {\textless}10,000 yr. The ages of tide-flat mud of the Nushagak Formation, derived from the Ahklun Mountains to the northwest of Bristol Bay, and of Halfmoon Bay drift, derived from the Alaska Peninsula to the southeast, suggest contemporaneous glacial-estuarine deposition related to independent glacial source areas about 75,000--80,000 yr ago. This age is consistent with other geochronological data that indicate a pre-late-Wisconsin and post-substage-5e age, including nonfinite14C ages, a lack of interglacial indicators, and Old Crow tephra ($\sim$140,000 yr) atop the drift, normal paleomagnetic inclinations, and amino acid (isoleucine) epimerization ratios (aIle/Ile). AIle/Ile ratios inPortlandia arctica(0.052 $\pm$ 0.003) from a marine-lag horizon at South Naknek beach, which separates Halfmoon Bay drift above from older glacial-estuarine drift below, are only slightly higher than inMya truncata(0.041 $\pm$ 0.007) from last-interglacial Pelukian deposits at Nome. As laboratory heating experiments show that the two genera epimerize at similar rates, these data imply correlation of the marine lag at South Naknek beach with Pelukian deposits. Hence, glaciers on the Alaska Peninsula experienced major pre-late-Wisconsin advances both before and after the last interglaciation. Shells reworked into Halfmoon Bay drift yield aIle/Ile ratios of 0.028 $\pm$ 0.005 forPortlandiaat Second Point and 0.027 $\pm$ 0.001 forHiatella arcticaat Etolin Point. Together with assumptions about the postdepositional temperature history, these ratios indicate that the shells are at least 55,000 yr, and probably closer to $\sim$90,000 yr, although the uncertainty in this age estimate is broad. The amino acid and luminescence data converge on an age between about 75,000, and 90,000 yr, late during oxygen-isotope stage 5, for a major ice advance far beyond late-Wisconsin limits.},

Age control is provided by 31 14 C, and biogenic silica (BSi) record marked environmental changes C ages on plant macrofossils in four cores between 5.2 and 8.6 m long. Major stratigraphic units are traceable throughout the lake subbottom in acoustical profiles, and provisional ages are derived for six prominent tephra beds, which are correlated among the cores. During the interstadial interval between 33 and 30 cal ka, OM and BSi contents are relatively high with values similar to those of the Pleistocene--Holocene transition, suggesting a similar level of aquatic productivity. During the glacial interval that followed (30--15 cal ka), OM and BSi decrease in parallel with declining summer insolation. OM and BSi values remain relatively uniform compared with the higher variability before and after this interval, and they show no major shifts that might correlate with climate fluctuations evidenced by the local moraine record, nor with other global climate changes. The glacial interval includes a clay-rich unit with a depauperate diatom assemblage that records the meltwater spillover of an ice- dammed lake. The meltwater pulse, and therefore the maximum extent of ice attained by a major outlet glacier of the Ahklun Mountain ice cap, lasted from 24 to 22 cal ka. The Pleistocene--Holocene transition (15--11 cal ka) exhibits the most prominent shifts in OM and BSi, but rapid and dramatic fluctuations in OM and BSi continue throughout the Holocene, indicating pronounced paleoenvrionmental changes.},

It summarises evidence used to draw glacial limits in 15 regions across the state and highlights the most significant changes from previous mapping. The chapter provides an overview of the glacial-geological record in Alaska, identifies prior efforts to synthesise data on Alaskan glacial geology and briefly discusses the broader implications of the newly mapped glacial extents. The chapter focuses on the two glacial limits that can most confidently be determined across the state: (1) the maximum extent of glaciers and (2) the Late Wisconsinan. The placement of the maximum glacial limit in many places is essentially an educated guess, based on extrapolation of limited data and guided by regional geographical patterns and general geomorphology. The extent of Late Wisconsinan glaciers is delimited more accurately. The distribution of Pleistocene glaciers largely follows that of present-day glaciers, with the most massive accumulations of ice proximal to the southern moisture sources. The maximum glacier extent was greater relative to the Late Wisconsinan for the western Brooks Range and for the Seward Peninsula than for other regions. The most extensive glaciers in the western part of the state probably grew when the adjacent continental shelves were submerged and the glaciers were preferentially nourished by a proximal moisture source that was cut off during the Late Wisconsinan.},

  abstract     = {The mobility of the lithosphere over a weaker asthenosphere constitutes the essential element of plate tectonics, and thus the understanding of the processes at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) is fundamental to understand how our planet works. It is especially so for oceanic plates because their relatively simple creation and evolution should enable easy elucidation of the LAB. Data from borehole broadband ocean bottom seismometers show that the LAB beneath the Pacific and Philippine Sea plates is sharp and age-dependent. The observed large shear wave velocity reduction at the LAB requires a partially molten asthenosphere consisting of horizontal melt-rich layers embedded in meltless mantle, which accounts for the large viscosity contrast at the LAB that facilitates horizontal plate motions.},

We focus on cores from the Laurentian Fan, which is known to have rapid and continuous accumulation of hemipelagic sediment. Although results among our various proxy data are not always in agreement, the weight of the evidence (alkenone sea surface temperature (SST), delta(18)O and abundance of Globigerinoides ruber) indicates a continual cooling of surface waters over Laurentian Fan, from about 18 degrees C in the early Holocene to about 8 degrees C today. Alternatively, Mg/Ca data on planktonic foraminifera indicate no systematic change in Holocene SST. The inferred long-term decrease in SST was probably driven by decreasing seasonality of Northern Hemisphere insolation. Two series of proxy data show the gradual cooling was interrupted by a two-step cold pulse that began 8500 years ago, and lasted about 700 years. Although this event is associated with the final deglaciation of Hudson Bay, there is no delta(18)O minimum anywhere in the Labrador Sea, yet there is some evidence for it as far south as Cape Hatteras. Finally, although the 8200 year B. P. event has been implicated in decreasing North Atlantic ventilation, and hence widespread temperature depression on land and at sea, we find inconsistent evidence for a change at that time in deep ocean nutrient content at similar to 4 km water depth.},

The core is well dated to 2/3 depth using cycle counting and reference horizons and a simple but close fitting model for the lower 1/3 of the core. This core suffers from modest seasonal melt, and so we present concentration data in decadal running means to minimize percolation effects. Sea-salt ions (Na+, Cl$-$, Mg2+, and K+) account for more than 70{\%} of all ions. In general, sea-salt ion concentrations are rather variable and have no clear association with climatic variations. Sulfate, with 74{\%} being from non-sea-salt sources, has higher concentrations than seen on Vestfonna ice cap but lower than in Ny-{\AA}lesund aerosols, suggesting central Spitsbergen receives more marine (westerly) air masses than Ny-{\AA}lesund but more sulfate enriched (easterly) air masses than Nordaustlandet. Clear anthropogenic impacts are found for sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium (and probably excess chloride) after the mid twentieth century, with sulfate showing a significant rise by the end of the nineteenth century. Sulfate and methanesulfonate concentrations correlate well during the twentieth century, and it is clear that most of the preindustrial sulfate is of biogenic origin. Terrestrial component (Ca2+) has the highest concentrations in the coldest part of the Little Ice Age, suggesting more windy conditions, transporting local terrestrial dust to the ice cap. All ion concentrations decrease at the end of the twentieth century, which reflects loss of ions by runoff, with non-sea-salt magnesium being particularly sensitive to melting.},

  abstract     = {We present a simple model of 3He and 4He transport in the mantle using the appropriate rates of mass and species transfer and 4He production. Previous workers have shown the presence of excess 3He in hotspots such as Hawaii and Iceland and inferred that these hotspots tap a source with a higher 3He4He ratio than the source region of mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB). Hotspot ocean islands probably originate over upwelling plumes which carry material from the lower mantle to the upper mantle. Melting at hotspots and at mid-ocean ridges degasses the mantle of volatiles such as helium. The upper mantle is outgassed largely of helium due to melting at mid-ocean ridges and hotspots. We postulate that the excess 3He seen in MORB originates in material that was carried from the lower mantle in plumes but not completely outgassed at hotspots. This helium is incorporated into the depleted upper mantle. Assuming that the upper mantle is in a quasi-steady-state with respect to helium, a simple model balancing 3He and 4He fluxes in the upper mantle indicates that the hotspots significantly outgas the lower mantle of 3He. The concentration of 4He in the plume source reservoir is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than the concentration in carbonaceous chondrites. The residence time of helium in the upper mantle depends on the outgassing efficiency at hotspots, since the hotspots may outgas some upper mantle material which has been entrained in the plumes. The residence time of He in the upper mantle is about 1.4 ?? 109 yr. We conclude that the efficiency of outgassing of He from plumes is high and that the plumes dominate the present 3He loss to the atmosphere. The 4He in the less depleted layer of the mantle is not trapped "primordial" but is predominantly from in situ decay of U and Th in the depleted layer over ??? 1.4 ?? 109 yr. The 4He in the lower mantle is dominantly from in situ decay of U and Th over 4.4 ?? 109 yr. This model appears to explain the total Ar in the atmosphere as there is about the same amount of K in the depleted mantle as is in the continents. ?? 1990.},

  abstract     = {This paper is the first to summarize research on fluctuations of local glaciers in Greenland (e.g. ice caps and mountain glaciers independent of the Greenland Ice Sheet) during latest Pleistocene and Holocene time. In contrast to the extensive data available for fluctuations of the Greenland Ice Sheet, surprisingly little data exist to constrain local glacier extents. Much of the available research was conducted prior to wide-spread use of AMS radiocarbon dating and the advent of surface-exposure and luminescence dating. Although there is a paucity of data, generally similar patterns of local glacier fluctuations are observed in all regions of Greenland and likely reflect changes in paleoclimate, which must have influenced at least the margins of the Inland Ice. Absolute-age data for late-glacial and early Holocene advances of local glaciers are reported from only two locations: Disko (island) and the Scoresby Sund region. Subsequent to late-glacial or early Holocene time, most local glaciers were smaller than at present or may have disappeared completely during the Holocene Thermal Maximum. In general, local glacier advances that occurred during Historical time (1200-1940 AD) are the most extensive since late-glacial or early Holocene time. Historical documents and more recent aerial photographs provide useful information about local glacier fluctuations during the last ???100??yrs. In all but one area (North Greenland), local glaciers are currently receding from Historical extents. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The stratigraphic record is interpreted as the product of three marine events (Saunders ??, Qarmat and Nuna, in decreasing age), during which marine sedimentation occurred on coastal areas now land, and three or four glacial events of decreasing age and ice cover (Agpat, Narsaarsuk, and Kap Abernathy/Wolstenholme Fjord), to which the marine events were glacio-isostatically related. Subarctic Atlantic water reached this northern part of Baffin Bay during all three marine events but the warmest conditions, warmer than the present, occurred in the Qarmat event, correlated with the deep sea Oxygen Isotope Stage 5e. The question of late Stage 5 events is considered. The Nuna event dates to latest Stage 2 and the Holocene, whilst the Saunders ?? event is of uncertain age but at least Stage 6. A number of glacial events with advances confined to the fjords are dated to Stage 2 (Wolstenholme Fjord), and late Stage 6 (Narsaarsuk) and an intermediate advance (Kap Abernathy) is undated in the range of Stage 2-5. Extension of glaciation to the shelf edge is dated to Stage 6 (Agpat event).},

  abstract     = {A key ingredient in understanding Earth structure is the integration of seismological information with results from mineral physics for both the dominant radial dependence of material properties and the 3D structure revealed by seismic tomography. In each case an important role is played by reference models for the internal structure of the Earth originally constructed to meet seismological needs. Representations of the travel times of seismic phases are required for the location of seismic events and these have been supplemented by models that match the frequencies of the free oscillation of the Earth, which have played a major role in characterising seismic sources through the centroid moment tensor derived from long-period records. Parameterised models were introduced to combat the computational demands of inversion and have been extensively used; however, in such models (e.g. PREM) the form of the seismic parameters is prescribed to have a functional behaviour, such as a cubic, based on mathematical convenience rather than physical requirements. Any 1D models face the challenge of the significant lateral heterogeneity at the top and bottom of the mantle, as well as the more subtle variations in between. It may well be possible to capture the long wavelength components of 3D heterogeneity, but the nature of available data sources means that it will be difficult to achieve comparable P and S definition for the whole mantle. In many circumstances reference models are used for comparison with models constructed for different data sets. It is then best that, e.g., a cratonic reference model is used to judge results from cratons. Regionalisation of travel-time observations provides a means of constructing such reference models for a broad range of tectonic environments. When coupled with suitable path corrections it is possible to make a good account of regional 2D variations. It is desirable that reference models used for interpretation of seismic tomography are tied as clearly as possible to mineral physics results, with a representation based on the bulk modulus K, shear modulus G and density rather than just the P and S wavespeeds. Comparator models for different mineral compositions and temperature regimes have the potential to aid the interpretation of tomographic images, particularly in the separation of the influences of temperature and composition. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Like its predecessor, ak135 is a radially stratified velocity model and the travel time tables are derived from the model so that a consistent basis exists for all phases. The P wave travel times are very similar to iasp91, but more significant changes are introduced for S and particularly the core phases.

A smoothed set of traveltime tables is extracted by a robust procedure which gives estimates of the variance of the traveltimes for each phase branch. This set of smoothed empirical times is then used to construct a range of radial velocity profiles, which are assessed against a number of different measures of the level of fit between the empirical times and the predictions of the models. These measures are constructed from weighted sums of L2 misfits for individual phases. The weights are chosen to provide a measure of the probable reliability of the picks for the different phases. A preferred model, ak1.?5, is proposed which gives a significantly better fit to a broad range of phases than is provided by the iusp9I and sp6 models. The differences in velocity between ak135 and these models are generally quite small except at the boundary of the inner core, where reduced velocity gradients are needed to achieve satisfactory performance for PKP differential time data. The potential resolution of velocity structure has been assessed with the aid of a non-linear search procedure in which 5000 models have been generated in bounds about ak135. Misfit calculations are performed for each of the phases in the empirical traveltime sets, and the models are then sorted using different overall measures of misfit. The best 100 models for each criterion are displayed in a model density plot which indicates the consistency of the different models. The interaction of information from different phases can be analysed by comparing the different misfit measures. Structure in the mantle is well resolved except at the base, and ak135 provides a good representation of core velocities.},

These features must have been created by late Cenozoic ice sheets, because rivers cannot erode bedrock much below sea level. Ice sheets drain primarily through fjords; therefore, widespread fjord insertion may have altered ice-sheet size, shape and dynamics. Here, we use a two-dimensional ice-sheet model to simulate the incision of fjords through a coastal mountain range. We show that topographic steering of ice and erosion proportional to ice discharge are sufficient to form fjords. Within one million years, kilometre-deep fjords punched through the mountain range owing to a robust positive feedback initiated by ice being steered towards mountain passes. Enhanced erosion beneath thicker, faster ice deepens these passes, amplifying the topographic steering. Simulated fjords are deepest through the highest topography and drain a large fraction of the interior ice. Ice sheets simulated on landscapes with existing fjords are generally smaller and exhibit longer response times and larger responses to climate changes, suggesting that modern ice sheets are more sensitive to climate fluctuations than Early Quaternary ice sheets. {\textcopyright} 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

  abstract     = {Recent estimates of Antarctica's present-day rate of ice-mass contribution to changes in sea level range from 31 gigatonnes a year (Gt yr(-1); ref. 1) to 246 Gt yr(-1) (ref. 2), a range that cannot be reconciled within formal errors. Time-varying rates of mass loss contribute to this, but substantial technique-specific systematic errors also exist. In particular, estimates of secular ice-mass change derived from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data are dominated by significant uncertainty in the accuracy of models of mass change due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). Here we adopt a new model of GIA, developed from geological constraints, which produces GIA rates systematically lower than those of previous models, and an improved fit to independent uplift data. After applying the model to 99 months (from August 2002 to December 2010) of GRACE data, we estimate a continent-wide ice-mass change of -69 $\pm$ 18 Gt yr(-1) (+0.19 $\pm$ 0.05 mm yr(-1) sea-level equivalent). This is about a third to a half of the most recently published GRACE estimates, which cover a similar time period but are based on older GIA models. Plausible GIA model uncertainties, and errors relating to removing longitudinal GRACE artefacts ('destriping'), confine our estimate to the range -126 Gt yr(-1) to -29 Gt yr(-1) (0.08-0.35 mm yr(-1) sea-level equivalent). We resolve 26 independent drainage basins and find that Antarctic mass loss, and its acceleration, is concentrated in basins along the Amundsen Sea coast. Outside this region, we find that West Antarctica is nearly in balance and that East Antarctica is gaining substantial mass.},

  abstract     = {Within analyses of Global Positioning System (GPS) observations, unmodeled subdaily signals propagate into long-period signals via a number of different mechanisms. In this paper, we investigate the effects of time-variable satellite geometry and the propagation of a time-constant unmodeled multipath signal. Multipath reflectors at H = 0.1 m, 0.2 m, and 1.5 m below the antenna are modeled, and their effects on GPS coordinate time series are examined. Simulated time series at 20 global IGS sites for 2000.0--2008.0 were derived using the satellite geometry as defined by daily broadcast orbits. We observe the introduction of time-variable biases in the time series of up to several millimeters. The frequency and magnitude of the signal is dependent on site location and multipath source. When adopting realistic GPS observation geometries obtained from real data (e.g., including the influence of local obstructions and hardware specific tracking), we observe generally larger levels of coordinate variation. In these cases, we observe spurious signals across the frequency domain, including very high frequency abrupt changes (offsets) in addition to secular trends. Velocity biases of more than 0.5 mm/yr are evident at some sites. The propagated signal has noise characteristics that fall between flicker and random walk and shows spectral peaks at harmonics of the draconitic year for a GPS satellite ($\sim$351 days).When a perfectly repeating synthetic constellation is used, the simulations show near-negligible time correlated noise highlighting that subtle variations in the GPS constellation can propagate multipath signals differently over time, producing significant temporal variations in time series.},

  abstract     = {Sediment successions from the Kanin Peninsula and Chyoshskaya Bay in northwestern Russia contain information on the marginal behaviour of all major ice sheets centred in Scandinavia, the Barents Sea and the Kara Sea during the Eemian Weichselian. Extensive luminescence dating of regional lithostratigraphical units, supported by biostratigraphical evidence, identifies four major ice advances at 100 90, 70 65, 55 45 and 20 18 kyr ago interbedded with lacustrine, glaciolacustrine and marine sediments. The widespread occurrence of marine tidal sediments deposited c. 65 60 kyr ago allows a stratigraphical division of the Middle Weichselian Barents Sea and Kara Sea ice sheets into two shelf-based glaciations separated by almost complete deglaciation. The first ice dispersal centre was in the Barents Sea and thereafter in the Kara Sea. It is possible to extract both flow patterns from ice marginal landforms inside the southward termination. Accordingly, it is proposed that the Markhida line and its western continuation are asynchronous and originate from two separate glaciations before and after the marine transgression. The marine sedimentation occurred during a eustatic sea-level rise of up to 20 m/1000 yr, i.e. the Mezen Transgression. We speculate that the rapid eustatic sea-level rise triggered a collapse of the Barents Sea Ice Sheet at the MIS (Marine Isotope Stage) 4 to 3 transition. This is motivated by lack of an early marine highstand, the timing of events, and the marginal position of Arkhangelsk relative to open marine conditions.},

New stable isotopic and sedimentological records from a northwest Atlantic sediment core reveal that the most prominent Holocene anomaly in bottom-water chemistry and flow speed in the deep limb of the Atlantic overturning circulation begins at approximately 8.38 thousand years B.P., coeval with the catastrophic drainage of Lake Agassiz. The influence of Lower North Atlantic Deep Water was strongly reduced at our site for approximately 100 years after the outburst, confirming the ocean's sensitivity to freshwater forcing. The similarities between the timing and duration of the pronounced deep circulation changes and regional climate anomalies support a causal link.},

  abstract     = {This paper examines ice-sheet wide variations in subglacial thermal regime and ice dynamics using the landform record exposed on the beds of former mid-latitude ice sheets (the Laurentide, Cordilleran, Fennoscandian and British-Irish Ice Sheets). We compare the landform patterns beneath these former ice sheets to the flow organisation beneath parts of the contemporary Antarctic Ice Sheet inferred from RADARSAT-1 Antarctic Mapping Project (RAMP) data. The evidence preserved in the landform record and observed on contemporary ice masses can be grouped into four major ice-dynamical components that collectively define the subglacial thermal organisation (STO) of ice sheets. These ice-dynamical components are frozen-bed patches, ice streams, ice-stream tributaries and lateral shear zones. Frozen-bed patches appear at a wide range of spatial scales, spanning four orders of magnitude. In some areas, frozen-bed zones comprise large proportions of the bed (e.g. near the ice divide in continental areas), whilst in other areas they constitute isolated "islands" in areas dominated by thawed-bed conditions. Ice streams, narrow zones of fast flow in ice sheets that are otherwise dominated by slow sheet flow, are also common features of Quaternary ice sheets. Tributaries to ice streams flow at velocities intermediate between full ice-stream and sheet flow, and may divert ice drainage from one primary ice-stream corridor to an adjacent one. Sharp lateral boundaries between landforms indicate sliding and non-sliding conditions, respectively. These lateral boundaries represent important discontinuities in the glacial landscape and mark the location of shear zones between thawed-bed ice streams and intervening frozen-bed areas. We use the landform evidence in the area around Great Bear Lake, Canada to trace the evolution of an ice-stream web through time, demonstrating that frozen-bed patches are integral components of this complex system. We conclude that frozen-bed patches are important for the stability of ice sheets because they laterally constrain and isolate peripheral drainage basins and their ice streams. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This uncertainty stems from difficulties in determining the basal temperatures of the ice sheets and the shear strength of subglacial materials4, a knowledge of which would better constrain reconstructions of ice-sheet thickness. Here we show that, in the absence of direct data, the occurrence of ribbed moraines in modern landscapes can be used to determine the former spatial distribution of frozen- and thawed-bed conditions. We argue that ribbed moraines were formed by brittle fracture of subglacial sediments, induced by the excessive stress at the boundary between frozen- and thawed-bed conditions resulting from the across-boundary difference in basal ice velocity. Maps of glacial landforms from aerial photographs of Canada and Scandinavia reveal a concentration of ribbed moraines around the ice-sheet retreat centres of Quebec, Keewatin, Newfoundland and west-central Fennoscandia. Together with the evidence from relict landscapes that mark glacial areas with frozen-bed conditions, the distribution of ribbed moraines on both continents suggest that a large area of the Laurentide and Fennoscandian ice sheets was frozen-based---and therefore high-domed and stable---during the Last Glacial Maximum.},

The model uses mapped flow traces and deglacial melt-water landforms, as well as relative chronologies derived from cross-cutting striae and till lineations, as input data. Flow-trace systems were classified into four types: (i) time-transgressive wet-bed deglacial fans, (ii) time-transgressive frozen-bed deglacial fans, (iii) surge fans, and (iv) synchronous non-deglacial (event) fans. Using relative chronologies and aggregation of fans into glaciologically plausible patterns, a series of ice-sheet configurations at different time slices was erected. A chronology was constructed through correlation with dated stratigraphical records and proxy data reflecting global ice volume. Geological evidence exists for several discrete ice-sheet configurations centred over the Scandinavian mountain range during the early Weichselian The build-up of the main Weichselian Fennoscandian ice sheet started at approximately 70 ka, and our results indicate that it was characterised by an ice sheet with a centre of mass located over southern Norway This configuration had a flow pattern which is poorly reproduced by current numerical models of the Fennoscandian ice sheet. At the Last Glacial Maximum the main ice divide was located over the Gulf of Bothnia. A major bend in the ice divide was caused by outflow of ice to the northwest over the lowest part of the Scandinavian mountain chain. Widespread areas of preserved pre-late-Weichselian landscapes indicate that the ice sheet had a frozen-bed core area, which was only partly diminished in size by inward-transgressive wet-bed zones during the decay phase.},

  abstract     = {A systematic comparison of a wide range of noise-reduction techniques applied to a single data set collected for this purpose was attempted. The study includes a comparison of the relative benefits of noise-reduction schemes for very different noise levels. The comparisons use computer simulations of field techniques for noise reduction as applied to deep crustal, 48-fold VIBROSEIS{\textregistered} data. The noise-reduction techniques involve amplitude scaling (diversity stacking and automatic gain control), noise editing (the use of fixed-gain and self-updating noise-rejection systems with and without buffered memory for recursive editing), and reduced numbers of recording bits (mantissa-only and sign-bit-only formats). The effectiveness of each noise-reduction procedure is assessed by a study of its effects on noise levels seen on source-point gathers and on both true-amplitude and amplitude-balanced common-midpoint (CMP) stacks. For low levels of ambient noise, true-amplitude CMP stacks can be substantially improved by the appropriate noise-reduction techniques, but CMP stacks incorporating gain control before CMP stacking show only minor improvements. In contrast, when a high level of ambient noise is present, both true-amplitude and gain-controlled CMP stacks can be greatly improved by appropriate noise-reduction processing before vertical stacking. Of procedures involving zeroing of noise bursts, self-updating noise-rejection systems were more effective than fixed-gain noise-rejection systems for all the conditions simulated here. A system incorporating recursive editing techniques is still more effective at low levels of ambient noise, but this system tends to edit recorded traces too severely at very high noise levels. Mantissa-only and sign-bit-only recording give very similar results, and show an effect comparable to that given by self-updating editing systems. Diversity stacking produced significant noise reduction in all conditions studied, and may be the most widely applicable and most generally useful of the noise-reduction methods studied here. {\textregistered}Trade and service mark of Conoco Inc.},

  abstract     = {The integration of 3D seismic data, well logs and synthetic seismic data has been used to identify an additional Intra Danian seismic horizon in the chalk reservoir of the Kraka Field, Danish North Sea. Mapping of this seismic horizon has allowed production of a separate thickness map for the main reservoir unit, the Danian Porous, in the greater Kraka area. The unit is less than 25 m thick in most areas and, to produce reliable reservoir maps, it has been necessary to use well data to guide the seismic interpretation. It is impossible, however, to resolve the reservoir stratigraphy properly in areas where the Danian Porous is thinner than c.15 m due to tuning effects.  The lateral porosity distribution has been mapped using a combination of well log data and seismic data inverted for acoustic impedance. The Danian Porous unit is characterized by average porosities over 28{\%} and shows no evidence of depth-related porosity reduction. Rather, the impedance data indicate the presence of positive porosity anomalies both over the crest and downflank towards the southeast. Comparison of impedance-derived porosities with those derived from well data indicates that the seismic-based data reflect the variations in porosity but underestimate the highest porosity by 3--4{\%}.  Faults and fractures are important for production of the Kraka Field. Detailed mapping of seismic horizons, supplemented with seismic attribute mapping, has proved useful for outlining areas with high fault intensity in the northwestern part of the field but has been unsuccessful in identifying individual faults as recognized from log data},

The synchronous timing of the cooling event in the Greenland ice-cores, marine record and tree-ring data from northwest Europe reflects a regional influence on the North Atlantic ocean--atmospheric system, suggesting a prominent role of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation. The operation of the North Atlantic ocean circulation is sensitive to variation in the freshwater budget, implying that any change in freshwater flux is capable of altering the North Atlantic circulation system.

Our findings show that subsequent to an ice- free period during the Miocene Climate Optimum MCO, similar to 17 - 15 Ma), glacially eroded materials from the uplifted northern Barents Sea were transported by iceberg flotillas toward the Fram Strait. The simultaneous opening of the North Atlantic - Arctic gateway provided pathways for iceberg transport from the north. The expansive ice growth is probably induced by both large- scale changes in ocean circulation due to enhanced flow of Atlantic water into the Arctic Ocean during opening of the gateway and concurrent global cooling during the MMCT.},

We present a continuous and exceptionally well-dated marine sediment record documenting the strong imprint of Arctic freshwater pulses on Earth's climate system throughout the past 0.8 m.y. Planktic foraminiferal oxygen and carbon isotope data reveal that freshwater plumes released from collapsing circum-Arctic ice sheets and ice-dammed lakes were advected to the Arctic Ocean gateway on sub-Milankovitch time scales. Given the close correspondence of Arctic freshwater pulses and strength of North Atlantic Deep Water formation as inferred from carbon isotope data, we conclude that freshening of the Arctic Ocean influenced thermohaline circulation more frequently than previously recognized. Our data show that it is critical for coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean general circulation models aimed at unraveling climate forcing factors during the Pleistocene to consider Arctic freshwater as a crucial forcing factor.},

  abstract     = {Based on a revised chronostratigraphy, and compilation of borehole data from the Barents Sea continental margin, a coherent glaciation model is proposed for the Barents Sea ice sheet over the past 3.5 million years (Ma). Three phases of ice growth are suggested: (1) The initial build-up phase, covering mountainous regions and reaching the coastline/shelf edge in the northern Barents Sea during short-term glacial intensification, is concomitant with the onset of the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (3.6-2.4??Ma). (2) A transitional growth phase (2.4-1.0??Ma), during which the ice sheet expanded towards the southern Barents Sea and reached the northwestern Kara Sea. This is inferred from step-wise decrease of Siberian river-supplied smectite-rich sediments, likely caused by ice sheet blockade and possibly reduced sea ice formation in the Kara Sea as well as glacigenic wedge growth along the northwestern Barents Sea margin hampering entrainment and transport of sea ice sediments to the Arctic-Atlantic gateway. (3) Finally, large-scale glaciation in the Barents Sea occurred after 1??Ma with repeated advances to the shelf edge. The timing is inferred from ice grounding on the Yermak Plateau at about 0.95??Ma, and higher frequencies of gravity-driven mass movements along the western Barents Sea margin associated with expansive glacial growth. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Both pulses are associated with major iceberg-rafted debris (IRD) events, revealing intensive iceberg/sea ice melting. The older meltwater pulse occurred near the MIS 5/6 boundary (???131,000 yr ago); its ???2000 year duration and high IRD input accompanied by high illite content suggest a collapse of large-scale Saalian Glaciation in the Arctic Ocean. Movement of this meltwater with the Transpolar Drift current into the Fram Strait probably promoted freshening of Nordic Seas surface water, which may have increased sea-ice formation and significantly reduced deep-water formation. A second pulse of freshwater occurred within MIS 5a (???77,000 yr ago); its high smectite content and relatively short duration is possibly consistent with sudden discharge of Early Weichselian ice-dammed lakes in northern Siberia as suggested by terrestrial glacial geologic data. The influence of this MIS 5a meltwater pulse has been observed at a number of sites along the Transpolar Drift, through Fram Strait, and into the Nordic Seas; it may well have been a trigger for the North Atlantic cooling event C20. ?? 2003 University of Washington.

Yet it is not possible to determine whether these fluctuations are genuinely oscillatory from the relatively short observational record alone. Using a 1400 year climate model calculation, we are able to simulate the observed pattern and amplitude of the AMO. The results imply the AMO is a genuine quasi-periodic cycle of internal climate variability persisting for many centuries, and is related to variability in the oceanic thermohaline circulation (THC). This relationship suggests we can attempt to reconstruct past THC changes, and we infer an increase in THC strength over the last 25 years. Potential predictability associated with the mode implies natural THC and AMO decreases over the next few decades independent of anthropogenic climate change.},

An abrupt climate change 8200 years ago (8.2 ka event) provides a test case to understand possible future climatic variability. Here, methane concentration (taken as an indicator for terrestrial hydrology) and nitrogen isotopes (Greenland temperature) in trapped air in a Greenland ice core (GISP2) are employed to scrutinize the evolution of the 8.2 ka event. The synchronous change in methane and nitrogen implies that the 8.2 ka event was a synchronous event (within ??4 years) at a hemispheric scale, as indicated by recent climate model results [Legrande, A. N., Schmidt, G. A., Shindell, D. T., Field, C. V., Miller, R. L., Koch, D. M., Faluvegi, G., Hoffmann, G., 2006. Consistent simulations of multiple proxy responses to an abrupt climate change event. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 103, 837-842]. The event began with a large-scale general cooling and drying around ???8175??30 years BP (Before Present, where Present is 1950 AD). Greenland temperature cooled by 3.3??1.1 ??C (decadal average) in less than ???20 years, and atmospheric methane concentration decreased by ???80??25 ppb over ???40 years, corresponding to a 15??5{\%} emission reduction. Hemispheric scale cooling and drying, inferred from many paleoclimate proxies, likely contributed to this emission reduction. In central Greenland, the coldest period lasted for ???60 years, interrupted by a milder interval of a few decades, and temperature subsequently warmed in several steps over ???70 years. The total duration of the 8.2 ka event was roughly 150 years. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Mapped data reveal coherent but spatially-complex regional patterns, suggesting the Younger Dryas was characterized by: (1) cooling in Southern Alaska, Eastern Siberia, and portions of Northeastern Siberia; and (2) uniform to warmer-than-present conditions through most of Central Alaska, Northeastern Siberia, and possibly the Russian Far East and Northern Alaska. The Beringian patterns correspond to distinctive large-scale climatic forcings, although in some locations further modified by more local influences, such as topography. General circulation models and modern synoptic climatology provide a conceptual framework for exploring possible mechanisms responsible for the observed changes. Forcings and associated climatic responses consistent with the proxy data include: (1) lowered sea-surface temperatures in the North Atlantic and Pacific reducing temperature and precipitation in Eastern Siberia; (2) intensified Aleutian low and lowered sea-surface temperatures causing cooler summers and higher winter precipitation in Southern Alaska; (3) stronger Pacific Subtropical High and an eastward shift of the East Asian Trough reducing summer temperatures in Southern Alaska and causing relative warmth in Northeastern Siberia; and (4) strong high pressure system producing warm, dry conditions in interior Alaska. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract     = {We present results from a combined multichannel seismic reflection (MCS) and wideangle onshore/offshore seismic experiment conducted in 1996 across the southeast Greenland continental margin. A new seismic tomographic method is developed to jointly invert refraction and reflection travel times for a two-dimensional velocity structure. We employ a hybrid ray-tracing scheme based on the graph method and the local ray-bending refinement to efficiently obtain an accurate forward solution, and we employ smoothing and optional damping constraints to regularize an iterative inversion. We invert 2318 Pg and 2078 PmP travel times to construct a compressional velocity model for the 350-km-long transect, and a long-wavelength structure with strong lateral heterogeneity is recovered, including (1) $\sim$30-km-thick, undeformed continental crust with a velocity of 6.0 to 7.0 km/s near the landward end, (2) 30- to 15-km-thick igneous crust within a 150-km-wide continent-ocean transition zone, and (3) 15- to 9-km-thick oceanic crust toward the seaward end. The thickness of the igneous upper crust characterized by a high-velocity gradient also varies from 6 km within the transition zone to $\sim$3 km seaward. The bottom half of the lower crust generally has a velocity higher than 7.0 km/s, reaching a maximum of 7.2 to 7.5 km/s at the Moho. A nonlinear Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis is performed to estimate the a posteriori model variance, showing that most velocity and depth nodes are well determined with one standard deviation of 0.05--0.10 km/s and 0.25--1.5 km, respectively. Despite significant variation in crustal thickness, the mean velocity of the igneous crust, which serves as a proxy for the bulk crustal composition, is surprisingly constant ($\sim$7.0 km/s) along the transect. On the basis of a mantle melting model incorporating the effect of active mantle upwelling, this velocity-thickness relationship is used to constrain the mantle melting process during the breakup of Greenland and Europe. Our result is consistent with a nearly constant mantle potential temperature of 1270--1340{$^{\circ}$}C throughout the rifting but with a rapid transition in the style of mantle upwelling, from vigorous active upwelling during the initial rifting phase to passive upwelling in the later phase.},

  abstract     = {The investigated roof region of a salt diapir in Hamburg, northern Germany, suffers sinkhole activity that was accompanied lately by microseismic events in the Gross Flottbek quarter. Thus, a high geohazard potential is present which can only be evaluated if highly resolved structural data are available. The urban environment and high building density required adapted and new, non-invasive geophysical methods for shallow applications (e.g., urban geophysics).Our shear-wave seismic system, under development at LIAG, consists of a small, horizontal vibrator source (ELVIS, v. 5.0) and a 120. m long, mobile land streamer equipped with 120 SH-geophones. Thereby, a cost-effective, complete shear-wave seismic survey is possible, which is dedicated to urban applications and accounts for sealed surfaces. This high-resolution system is especially useful on sealed terrain because of the absence of suppressed (Love) surface waves, and it provides in the near surface an up to 10-times higher resolution than a compressional-wave survey.Across the Wobbe See sinkhole in Gross Flottbek, we acquired 500 profile m of high-resolution shear-wave seismic data that enabled urban subsurface imaging with 1. m vertical and 5-10. m horizontal resolution. Small-scale structures in the sediments and salt are resolved down to 100. m depth. We show that it is possible (1) to classify a sinkhole type structurally and (2) to map subrosion areas by the physical property of lowered shear-wave velocities and a chaotic reflection character. Collapse depth is found here at ca. 60-80. m depth below surface, and the fault structures observed coincide well with the focal depth and mechanism of the 2009 microseismic events. Additionally, the diapir model is refined locally in terms of rock salt depth suggested here lying as shallow as 80-100. m below surface. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Relative to a North Americafixed reference frame, westward velocities increase rapidly across the Wasatch fault system, which comprises the plateaus northwestern margin, but increase more gradually between the Great Plains and the Mojave Desert province. We detect no significant extension across most of the Rio Grande Rift, but extension could be as high as 0.5 mm yr1 along its southernmost portion. We suggest that the motion between the plateau and stable continent may partly be accommodated instead across the Jemez Lineament. Only when we consider GPS velocities within the plateaus center, do the data support a rigid body rotation of 0.103 Ma1 around a pole in the northern Rocky Mountains. We conclude that active extension has encroached into the plateau from both the east and west.},

  abstract     = {Large debris-flow units commonly occur on the distal sides of subaqueous end moraines deposited by surges of Svalbard tidewater glaciers, but have rarely been described in terrestrial settings. Some researchers have argued that these kinds of debris flows reflect processes unique to the subaqueous environment, such as the extrusion of subglacial deforming layers or extensive failure of oversteepened moraine fronts. In this paper, we describe terrestrial and subaqueous parts of a single late Holocene moraine system deposited by a major surge of the tidewater glacier Paulabreen in west Spitsbergen. The ice-marginal landforms on land closely resemble the corresponding landforms on the seabed as evidenced by geomorphic mapping and geophysical profiles from both environments. Both onland and offshore, extensive areas of hummocky moraine occur on the proximal side of the maximum glacier position, and large mud aprons (interpreted as debris flows) occur on the distal side. We show that the debris-flow sediments were pushed in front of the advancing glacier as a continuously failing, mobile push moraine. We propose that the mud aprons are end members of a proglacial landforms continuum that has thrust-block moraines as the opposite end member. Two clusters of dates ({\~{}} 8000??YBP and {\~{}} 700??YBP) have previously been interpreted to indicate two separate surges responsible for the moraine formation. New dates suggest that the early cluster indicates a local extinction of the abounded species Chlamys islandica. Other changes corresponding to the widespread 8.2??ka event within the fjord, may suggest that the extinction of the C. islandica corresponds to that time. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

All the valleys are buried; they are up to 39 km long, 3-4 km wide and up to 350 m deep. The valleys are part of a vast tunnel valley province covering an area of some 0.5 million km2 of the formerly glaciated lowland areas of North West Europe. The valleys consist of non-branching, non-anastomosing troughs; they exhibit strongly undulating bottom profiles with numerous sub-basins and thresholds, and are characterised by adverse end slopes. Cross-cutting relationships and theoretical considerations suggest the occurrence of seven major episodes of valley incision attributed to ice marginal oscillations within a few glacials. Calculations considering the valley end gradients and theoretical ice-surface profiles suggest that the valleys were formed by pressurised subglacial meltwater erosion. Given a range of theoretical ice-surface profiles, the adverse end slopes are well beyond the supercooling threshold, which suggests that the water was not in thermal equilibrium with the basal ice and that flow was concentrated in substantial conduits with sufficient mass and flux to maintain water temperature well above the freezing point.

Yet the question of which physical mechanisms ultimately drive the AMOC, in the sense of providing its energy supply, remains a matter of controversy. Here we review both observational data and model results concerning the two main candidates: vertical mixing processes in the ocean's interior and wind-induced Ekman upwelling in the Southern Ocean. In distinction to the energy source we also discuss the role of surface heat and freshwater fluxes, which influence the volume transport of the meridional overturning circulation and shape its spatial circulation pattern without actually supplying energy to the overturning itself in steady state. We conclude that both wind-driven upwelling and vertical mixing are likely contributing to driving the observed circulation. To quantify their respective contributions, future research needs to address some open questions, which we outline.},

  abstract     = {During a recent (2006) cruise of RV 'Dana' high resolution side-scan sonar and sub-bottom profiling was carried out on selected shelf and slope transects offshore Disko Bugt, central West Greenland. Available commercial seismic data from the margin indicate here irregular seabed morphology with erosional features locally extending down to c. 1100{~}m water depth. The newly acquired side-scan sonar data reveal the presence of giant iceberg plow marks extending (sub)parallel to the slope between about 800 and 1085{~}m water depth. The height difference between bottom of the scours and rim crest is up to 40{~}m. The largest plow marks are about 750{~}m wide. To date no observed modern icebergs including those from Antarctica have drafts in excess of c. 500{~}m. Taking into account maximum glacial sea level lowering of c. 120{~}m, the paleo-iceberg keel depth was at least 950{~}m. Due to the presence of the relatively shallow ({\textless} 700{~}m) sill of Davis Strait to the south, calving of these paleo-icebergs is thought to have occurred from an ice margin in the Baffin Bay region (Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae} paleo-ice stream?). The depth of occurrence ({\textgreater} 1000{~}m) and dimensions of the plow marks are concluded to be exceptional, and comparable to glacial scouring features reported from the Arctic Ocean. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

According to seismological practice, we call the negative phase the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB). The seismic lithosphere under most of the Iceland and large parts of central Greenland is about 80 km thick. This depth in Iceland is in disagreement with estimates of the thickness of the elastic lithosphere (10-20 km) found from postglacial rebound data. In the region of flood basalts in eastern Greenland, which overlies the proposed Iceland plume track, the lithosphere is only 70 km thick, about 10 km less than in Iceland which is located directly above the proposed plume. At the western Greenland coast, the lithosphere thickens to 100-120 km, with no indication of the Iceland plume track identified.

  abstract     = {The breakup of the supercontinent Gondwanaland into Africa, Antarctica, Australia and India about 140 million years ago, and consequently the opening of the Indian Ocean, is thought to have been caused by heating of the lithosphere from below by a large plume whose relicts are now the Marion, Kerguelen and R{\'{e}}union plumes. Plate reconstructions based on palaeomagnetic data suggest that the Indian plate attained a very high speed (18-20 cm yr(-1) during the late Cretaceous period) subsequent to its breakup from Gondwanaland, and then slowed to approximately 5 cm yr(-1) after the continental collision with Asia approximately 50 Myr ago. The Australian and African plates moved comparatively less distance and at much lower speeds of 2-4 cm yr(-1) (refs 3-5). Antarctica remained almost stationary. This mobility makes India unique among the fragments of Gondwanaland. Here we propose that when the fragments of Gondwanaland were separated by the plume, the penetration of their lithospheric roots into the asthenosphere were important in determining their speed. We estimated the thickness of the lithospheric plates of the different fragments of Gondwanaland around the Indian Ocean by using the shear-wave receiver function technique. We found that the fragment of Gondwanaland with clearly the thinnest lithosphere is India. The lithospheric roots in South Africa, Australia and Antarctica are between 180 and 300 km deep, whereas the Indian lithosphere extends only about 100 km deep. We infer that the plume that partitioned Gondwanaland may have also melted the lower half of the Indian lithosphere, thus permitting faster motion due to ridge push or slab pull.},

The comparison of the elevation measurements shows that they agree quite well with correlations of around 0.9 for individual shots and a bias of less than 2 cm. The differences are found to decrease quite rapidly when applying running means. The comparison of the roughness measurements show that there are significant differences between the two data sets, with ICESat generally having higher values. The roughness values are only moderately correlated on an individual-shot basis, but applying running means to the data significantly improves the correlations to as high as 0.9. For the conversion of the elevation measurements into snow-ice freeboard, ocean surface elevation estimates are made with the high-resolution laser altimeter data, as well as several methods using lower resolution ICESat data. Under optimum conditions, i.e., when leads that are larger than the ICESat footprint are present, the ICESat- and Airborne Topographic Mapper-derived freeboards are found to agree to within 2 cm. For other areas, ICESat tends to underestimate the freeboard by up to 9 cm.},

Our modeling approach is improved and more comprehensive compared to our earlier studies and involves the development and implementation of a new spherically symmetric reference model, simultaneous inversion for velocity and anisotropy, as well as discontinuity topographies, and implementation of nonlinear crustal corrections for waveforms. A comparison of our new three-dimensional model, S362ANI, with two other models derived from comparable data sets but using different techniques reveals persistent features: (1) strong, $\sim$200-km-thick, high-velocity anomalies beneath cratons, likely representing the continental lithosphere, underlain by weaker, fast anomalies extending below 250 km, which may represent continental roots, (2) weak velocity heterogeneity between 250 and 400 km depths, (3) fast anomalies extending horizontally up to 2000--3000 km in the mantle transition zone beneath subduction zones, (4) lack of strong long-wavelength heterogeneity below 650 km suggesting inhibiting character of the upper mantle--lower mantle boundary, and (5) slow-velocity superplumes beneath the Pacific and Africa. The shear wave radial anisotropy is strongest at 120 km depth, in particular beneath the central Pacific. Lateral anisotropic variations appreciably improve the fit to data that are predominantly sensitive to the uppermost and lowermost mantle but not to the waveforms that control the transition zone and midmantle depths. Tradeoffs between lateral variations in velocity and anisotropy are negligible in the uppermost mantle but noticeable at the bottom of the mantle.},

  abstract     = {Mapping crustal thickness, continental lithosphere thinning and oceanic lithosphere distribution represents a sub-stantial challenge for the Polar Regions. The Arctic region formed as a series of small distinct ocean basins leading to a complex distribution of oceanic crust, thinned continental crust and rifted continental margins. Antarctica, both peripherally and internally, experienced poly-phase rifting and continental breakup. We determine Moho depth, crustal basement thickness, continental lithosphere thinning and ocean--continent transition location for the Polar Regions using a gravity inversion method which incorporates a lithosphere thermal gravity anomaly correction. The method is carried out in the 3D spectral domain and predicts Moho depth and incorporates a lithosphere thermal gravity anomaly correction. Ice thickness is included in the gravity inversion, as is the contribution from sediments which assumes a compaction controlled sediment density increase with depth. A correction to the predicted con-tinental lithospheric thinning derived from gravity inversion is made for volcanic material addition produced by decompression melting during continental rifting and seafloor spreading. For the Arctic, gravity data used is from the NGA (U) Arctic Gravity Project, bathymetry is from IBCAO and sediment thickness is from a new regional compilation. For Antarctica and the Southern Oceans, data used are elevation and bathymetry, free-air gravity anomaly, ice and sediment thickness from Smith and Sandwell (2008), Sandwell and Smith (2008) and Laske and Masters (1997) respectively, supplemented by Bedmap2 data south of 60 degrees south. Using gravity anomaly inversion, we have produced the first comprehensive maps of crustal thickness and oceanic lithosphere distribution for the Arctic, Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. Our gravity inversion predicts thin crust and high continental lithosphere thinning factors in the Makarov, Podvodnikov, Nautilus and Canada Basins consistent with these basins being oceanic or highly thinned continental crust. Larger crustal thicknesses, in the range 20 -- 30 km, are predicted for the Lomonosov, Alpha and Mendeleev Ridges. Moho depths predicted compare well with seismic estimates. Predicted very thin continental or oceanic crust under the North Chuchki Basin and Laptev Sea has major impli-cations for understanding the plate tectonic history of the Amerasia Basin. Our gravity inversion study predicts thick crust ({\textgreater} 45 km) under interior East Antarctica. Thin crust is predicted under the West Antarctica Rift System and the Ross Sea. Continent scale rifts are also seen within East Antarctica. Intermediate crustal thickness with a pronounced rift fabric is predicted under Coates Land. An extensive region of either thick oceanic crust or highly thinned continental crust is predicted offshore Oates Land and north Victoria Land. Superposition of illuminated satellite gravity data onto crustal thickness maps from gravity inversion provides improved determination of rift orientation, pre-breakup rifted margin conjugacy and continental breakup trajectory (e.g. for the Southern Ocean). Gravity inversion predictions of crustal thickness, OCT location and oceanic lithosphere distribution may be used to test plate tectonic reconstructions. Using gravity anomaly inversion mapping of continental lithosphere thinning we have developed and applied a new technique to predict basement heat-flow, important for the prediction of ice-sheet stability, for the Polar Regions.},

  abstract      = {Accurate prediction of future climate scenarios is contingent on our understanding of past and present climate mechanisms. This is done in part through the reconstruction of historical climate changes using proxy records from terrestrial and marine archives. Terrestrial archives covering the Holocene and late Pleistocene are limited, most acutely in the Southern Hemisphere. Here, Rare earth elements (REE) and Pb isotopes are developed as inorganic geochemical proxies of mineral dust source changes and, by extension, climate change. Using a peat core from Lynch's Crater in NE Queensland, Australia, we present the first long-term (c. 52 kyr) terrestrial record of atmospheric REE and Pb deposition (with the exception of four wet events which represent periods of erosion from the crater itself) in the Southern Hemisphere covering both glacial and interglacial times. Based on a combination of correlation analyses, Al and Ti normalised profiles and elemental patterns, we establish REE are immobile within the peat deposit and not subject to significant post depositional diagenetic changes (important particularly for Ce). This is vital as REE can be mobile under acid and organic rich conditions like those that can occur during the development of a peat deposit. The volcanic provinces of eastern Australia have characteristic Eu anomaly signatures, which allowed their use in a novel way to detect changes in dust source to Lynch's Crater. Between 41,095 and 52,505 BP the deposit was under the influence of dust carried by long distance transport ({\textgreater}1500 km) from SE Australia. From 8525 to 40,815 BP regional sources (100-1500 km) dominated the deposited signals while between 1740 and 8390 BP the dust signal was controlled by local sources ({\textless}100 km). These findings were also confirmed by Pb isotope data. Changepoint modelling refined the timing of these changes in dust source, recognizing concurrent shifts in our tracing tools ((Eu/Eu*)PAAS and 206Pb/207Pb). These changepoints were then compared to other palaeoenvironmental records (pollen, lake levels and dune building) from eastern Australia and found to be similar. Our results demonstrate that REE and Pb isotopes are effective tools for tracing past changes in atmospheric dust sources and to the study of climate change using minerotrophic peat deposits. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract     = {Based on studies of sediment accumulations deposited from-and erode by-alongslope flowing ocean currents on the European continental margin from Porcupine (Ireland) to Lofoten (Norway), the evolution of the Cenozoic paleocirculation was reconstructed as part of the STRATAGEM project. There is evidence of ocean current-controlled erosion and deposition in the Rockall Trough, in the Faeroe-Shetland Channel and on the V??ring Plateau since the late Eocene, although the circulation pattern remains ambiguous. The late Palaeogene flow in the Rockall Trough was almost probably driven by southerly-derived Tethyan Outflow Water. The extent and strength of any northerly-derived flow is uncertain. From the early Neogene (early-mid-Miocene), there was a massive regional expansion of contourite drift development both in the North Atlantic and in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea. This was most probably related to the development of the Faroe Conduit, the opening of the Fram Strait and the general subsidence of the Greenland-Scotland Ridge. These may have combined to cause a considerable acceleration in the exchange and overflow of deep waters between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. An early late Neogene (late early Pliocene) regional erosional event has been ascribed to a vigorous pulse of bottom-current activity, most probably the result of a global reorganisation of ocean currents associated with the closure of the Central American Seaway. During the late Neogene, contourites and sediment drifts developed in deep-water basins, between units of glacigenic sediments as well as infill of several paleo-slide scars. These sediments were derived from areas of bottom-current erosion as well as from the development of Plio-Pleistocene prograding sediment wedges, incorporating the extensive sediment supply derived from shelf-wide ice sheets. Presently a profound winnowing prevails along the shelf and upper slope due to the inflowing currents of Atlantic water. Depocentres of sediments derived from the winnowing are located (locally) in lower slope embayments and in slide scars. ?? 2005 J.S. Laberg. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {The surprising linear relation between surface heat flow and heat production in plutons is easily explained in terms of an exponential decrease of heat production with depth in the crust. If the linear relation is assumed to be true in a mathematical sense, it can be shown that this is the only possible explanation, provided that three other assumptions that seem geologically reasonable are made. The decrement D of the exponential function is determined empirically from surface observations since theory requires that it be equal to the slope parameter of the linear relation. Recently published heat-flow results indicate that D varies little from one province to z-mother, and this suggests a model in which D is a general geochemical property of the crust beneath plutons. The outer layer of variable heat production, suggested by the linear relation, is identified with a zone of partial melting in which the heat-producing elements were redistributed exponentially during the plutonic process. The analysis suggests that this zone typically includes a substantial portion of the crust, and that the upward concentration of crustal heat production and heat flow from much of the continental mantle are both somewhat greater than has generally been supposed. The model leads to simple estimates of crustal temperatures beneath plutons.},

  abstract     = {Mid-latitude eddies are an important component of the climatic system due to their role in transporting heat, moisture and momentum from the tropics to the poles, and also for the precipitation associated with their fronts, especially in winter. We study northern hemisphere storm-tracks at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and their influence on precipitation using ocean-atmosphere general circulation model (OAGCM) simulations from the second phase of the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP2). The difference with PMIP1 results in terms of sea-surface temperature forcing, fundamental for storm-track dynamics, is large, especially in the eastern North Atlantic where sea-ice extends less to the south in OAGCMs compared to atmospheric-only GCMs. Our analyses of the physics of the eddies are based on the equations of eddy energetics. All models simulate a consistent southeastward shift of the North Pacific storm-track in winter, related to a similar displacement of the jet stream, partly forced by the eddies themselves. Precipitation anomalies are consistent with storm-track changes, with a southeastward displacement of the North Pacific precipitation pattern. The common features of North Atlantic changes in the LGM simulations consist of a thinning of the storm-track in its western part and an amplification of synoptic activity to the southeast, in the region between the Azores Islands and the Iberian Peninsula, which reflects on precipitation. This southeastward extension is related to a similar displacement of the jet, partly forced by the eddies. In the western North Atlantic, the synoptic activity anomalies are at first order related to baroclinic generation term anomalies, but the mean-flow baroclinicity increase due to the presence of the Laurentide ice-sheet is partly balanced by a loss of eddy efficiency to convert energy from the mean flow. Moisture availability in this region is greatly reduced due to more advection of dry polar air by stationary waves, leading to less synoptic-scale latent heat release and hence less precipitation also. In terms of seasonality, the stormy season is shifted later in the year by a few days to a month depending on the season and the model considered. This shift does not directly reflect on the first-order seasonal cycle of precipitation, which also depends on other mechanisms, especially in summer.},

  abstract      = {S U M M A R Y The Terre Ad{\'{e}}lie and George V Land (East Antarctica) represent key areas for understand-ing tectonic relationships between terranes forming the Neoarchean-Palaeoproterozoic Terre Ad{\'{e}}lie Craton (TAC) and the neighbouring lithospheric blocks, together with the nature of its boundary. This region that represents the eastern border of the TAC is limited on its eastern side by the Mertz shear zone (MSZ) separating more recent Palaeozoic units from the craton. The MSZ, that recorded dextral strike-slip movement at 1.7 and 1.5 Ga, is likely correlated with the Kalinjala or Coorong shear zone in South Australia, east of the Gawler Craton and may therefore represent a frozen lithospheric-scale structure. In order to investigate the litho-spheric structure of the TAC and the MSZ, we deployed from 2009 October to 2011 October four temporary seismic stations, which sampled the various lithospheric units of the TAC and of the neighbouring Palaeozoic block, together with the MSZ. We used receiver function method to deduce Moho depths and seismic anisotropy technique to infer the upper mantle deformation. Results from receiver functions analysis reveal Moho at 40--44 km depth beneath the TAC, at 36 km under the MSZ and at 28 km beneath the eastern Palaeozoic domain. The MSZ therefore delimits two crustal blocks of different thicknesses with a vertical offset of the Moho of 12 km. Seismic anisotropy deduced from SKS splitting at stations on the TAC shows fast polarisation directions () trending E--W, that is, parallel to the continental margin, and delay times ($\delta$t) ranging from 0.8 to 1.6 s. These results are similar to the splitting parameters observed at the permanent GEOSCOPE Dumont D'Urville station (DRV: 95 $\bullet$ N, $\delta$t 1.1 s) located in the Palaeoproterozoic domain of TAC. On the MSZ, the small number of good qual-ity measurements limits the investigation of the deep signature of the shear zone. However, the station in the Palaeozoic domain shows trending N60 $\bullet$ E, which is significantly different to the trending measurements from stations on the TAC, suggesting that the MSZ may also represent a major frontier between the Neoarchean-Palaeoproterozoic and Palaeozoic terranes.},

  abstract     = {Direct evidence for Late Weichselian grounded glacier ice over extensive areas of the Barents Sea is based largely on indirect observations, including elevations of old shorelines on Svalbard and arguments of isostatic rebound. Such isostatic models are discussed here for two cases representing maximum and minimum ice-sheet reconstructions. In the former model the ice extends over the Kara Sea, whereas in the latter the ice is limited to the Barents Sea and island archipelagos. Comparisons of predictions with observations from a number of areas, including Spitsbergen, Nordaustlandet, Edge??ya, Kong Karls Land, Franz Josef Land, Novaya Zemlya and Finnmark, support arguments for the existence of a large ice sheet over the region at the time of the last glacial maximum. This ice sheet is likely to have had the following characteristics, conclusions that are independent of assumptions made about the Earth's rheological parameters. (i) The maximum thickness of this ice was about 1500-2000 m with the centre of the load occurring to the south and east of Kong Karls Land. (ii) The ice sheet extended out to the western edge of the continental shelf and its maximum thickness over western Spitsbergen was about 800 m. (iii) To the north of Svalberg and Frans Josef Land the ice sheet extended out to the northern shelf edge. (iv) Retreat of the grounded ice across the southern Barents Sea occurred relatively early such that this region was largely ice free by about 15,000 BP. (v) By 12,000 BP the grounded ice had retreated to the northern archipelagos and was largely gone by 10,000 BP. (vi) The ice sheet may have extended to the Kara Sea but ice thicknesses were only a fraction of those proposed in those reconstructions where the maximum ice thickness is centered on Novaya Zemlya. Models for the palaeobathymetry for the Barents Sea at the time of the last glacial maximum indicate that large parts of the Barents Sea were either very shallow or above sea level, providing the opportunity for ice growth on the emerged plateaux, as well as on the islands, but only towards the end of the period of Fennoscandian ice sheet build-up. ?? 1995.},

Instead, the ice sheet extended out to the edge of the shelf and attained a maximum thickness of the order of 3000 m over the central region of the Barents Sea. Ice volumes to the east of Novaya Zemlya have been small compared to the ice over the Barents Sea.

  abstract     = {Using glacial rebound models we have inverted observations of crustal rebound and shoreline locations to estimate the ice thickness for the major glaciations over northern Eurasia and to predict the palaeo-topography from late MIS-6 (the Late Saalian at c. 140 kyr BP) to MIS-4e (early Middle Weichselian at c. 64 kyr BP). During the Late Saalian, the ice extended across northern Europe and Russia with a broad dome centred from the Kara Sea to Karelia that reached a maximum thickness of c. 4500 m and ice surface elevation of c. 3500 m above sea level. A secondary dome occurred over Finland with ice thickness and surface elevation of 4000 m and 3000 m, respectively. When ice retreat commenced, and before the onset of the warm phase of the early Eemian, extensive marine flooding occurred from the Atlantic to the Urals and, once the ice retreated from the Urals, to the Taymyr Peninsula. The Baltic - White Sea connection is predicted to have closed at about 129 kyr BP, although large areas of arctic Russia remained submerged until the end of the Eemian. During the stadials (MIS-5d, 5b, 4) the maximum ice was centred over the Kara - Barents Seas with a thickness not exceeding c. 1200 m. Ice-dammed lakes and the elevations of sills are predicted for the major glacial phases and used to test the ice models. Large lakes are predicted for west Siberia at the end of the Saalian and during MIS-5d, 5b and 4, with the lake levels, margin locations and outlets depending inter alia on ice thickness and isostatic adjustment. During the Saalian and MIS-5d, 5b these lakes overflowed through the Turgay pass into the Aral Sea, but during MIS-4 the overflow is predicted to have occurred north of the Urals. West of the Urals the palaeo-lake predictions are strongly controlled by whether the Kara Ice Sheet dammed the White Sea. If it did, then the lake levels are controlled by the topography of the Dvina basin with overflow directed into the Kama - Volga river system. Comparisons of predicted with observed MIS-5b lake levels of Komi Lake favour models in which the White Sea was in contact with the Barents Sea.},

  abstract     = {The timing, extent and configuration of the Late Weichselian Barents ice sheet has been debated for several decades. This debate has arisen largely because of the limited or conflicting field evidence on which most models have been based. In particular, reconstruction of the marine parts of the former Barents ice sheet has been controversial. This paper aims to review the geological observations and interpretations regarding the size and timing of the Late Weichselian ice sheet, combined with numerical modelling of its formation in order to produce a reconstruction of ice sheet extent and behaviour. Sub-glacial till with overlying glacimarine deposits dated to the Late Weichselian is found over most of the Barents Sea floor and the continental shelf west of Svalbard. Glacially induced debris flow deposits on the large Bjonoya and Isfjorden trough mouth fans strongly support the idea of ice sheet extension to the shelf edge during maximum glaciation. Isobase maps show a centre of post-glacial uplift in the north-central Barents Sea, and glaciological and isostatic modelling suggest that the ice sheet was 2000-3000 m thick in this area. The ice sheet was confluent with ice over the Kara Sea, but the interaction between the Barents and Kara ice sheets is not yet fully understood. The deglaciation of the Barents ice sheet started ca 15 ka, probably by calving within the deeper troughs. By 12 ka, most of the central Barents Sea was ice free, and ice remained over the Svalbard, Franz Josef Land and Novaja Zemlya archipelagos and adjacent shallow shelf areas. The coasts and fjords of these islands were ice free by 10 ka.},

A prominent moraine system on the shelf shows minimum Late Weichselian ice extent, indicating that glacial ice also covered the coastal lowlands of northwest Svalbard. Our results suggest that the cross-shelf trough was filled by a fast-flowing ice stream, with sharp boundaries to dynamically less active ice on the adjacent shelves and strandflats. The latter glacial mode favoured the preservation of older geological records adjacent to the main pathway of the Kongsfjorden glacial system. We suggest that the same model may apply to the Late Weichselian glacier drainage along other fjords of northwest Svalbard, as well as the western margin of the Barents Ice Sheet. Such differences in glacier regime may explain the apparent contradictions between the marine and land geological record, and may also serve as a model for glaciation dynamics in other fjord regions.},

  abstract     = {Five regionally significant Weichselian glacial events, each separated by terrestrial and marine interstadial conditions, are described from northwestern Russia. The first glacial event took place in the Early Weichselian. An ice sheet centred in the Kara Sea area dammed up a large lake in the Pechora lowland. Water was discharged across a threshold on the Timan Ridge and via an ice-free corridor between the Scandinavian Ice Sheet and the Kara Sea Ice Sheet to the west and north into the Barents Sea. The next glaciation occurred around 75 - 70 kyr BP after an interstadial episode that lasted c. 15 kyr. A local ice cap developed over the Timan Ridge at the transition to the Middle Weichselian. Shortly after deglaciation of the Timan ice cap, an ice sheet centred in the Barents Sea reached the area. The configuration of this ice sheet suggests that it was confluent with the Scandinavian Ice Sheet. Consequently, around 70 - 65 kyr BP a huge ice-dammed lake formed in the White Sea basin ( the 'White Sea Lake'), only now the outlet across the Timan Ridge discharged water eastward into the Pechora area. The Barents Sea Ice Sheet likely suffered marine down-draw that led to its rapid collapse. The White Sea Lake drained into the Barents Sea, and marine inundation and interstadial conditions followed between 65 and 55 kyr BP. The glaciation that followed was centred in the Kara Sea area around 55 - 45 kyr BP. Northward directed fluvial runoff in the Arkhangelsk region indicates that the Kara Sea Ice Sheet was independent of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet and that the Barents Sea remained ice free. This glaciation was succeeded by a c. 20-kyr-long ice-free and periglacial period before the Scandinavian Ice Sheet invaded from the west, and joined with the Barents Sea Ice Sheet in the northernmost areas of northwestern Russia. The study area seems to be the only region that was invaded by all three ice sheets during the Weichselian. A general increase in ice-sheet size and the westwards migrating ice-sheet dominance with time was reversed in Middle Weichselian time to an easterly dominated ice-sheet configuration. This sequence of events resulted in a complex lake history with spillways being re-used and ice-dammed lakes appearing at different places along the ice margins at different times.},

The diamicts represent multiple glacial advances by the Barents Sea and the Kara Sea ice sheets during the Weichselian. The diamicts and stratigraphically older lacustrine, fluvial and shallow marine sediments have been thrust as nappes by the Barents Sea and Kara Sea ice sheets. Based on stratigraphic position, OSL dating, sea level information and pollen, it is evident that the sorted sediments were deposited in the Late Eemian-Early Weichselian. Sedimentation started in lake basins and continued in shallow marine embayments when the lakes opened to the sea. The observed transition from lacustrine to shallow marine sedimentation could represent coastal retreat during stable or rising sea level.},

Surprisingly, throughout the succession the till fabric is unidirectional and very highly clustered (mean S1 = 0.876) and standard fabric interpretation methods including binary and triangular diagrams failed to differentiate between the three units and constrain the origin of the till facies. It is shown that the a-axis length as well as the ratio between a/b and a/c axes has no effect on the fabric strength, and there is no correlation between the fabric strength and clast size within the 0.7-5.6 cm grain-size range. The bootstrapping method applied to test the statistical significance of variance shows that (1) some variations in the fabric strength within the same till facies are due to the sampling effect, while other variations can be interpreted as true effects of strain, and (2) fabric strength may vary significantly over very short distances within the same till facies. Very high fabric strength in the deformation till is inconsistent with a model of weak to moderate fabric strength resulting from penetrative deformation, supporting the theory that subglacial deforming tills behave as Coulomb plastic rather than viscous materials.},

  abstract     = {Elisebreen, a retreating valley glacier in NW Svalbard, experienced a surge in the past, possibly during the Little Ice Age when ice was thicker and the bed warmer. The surge produced an assemblage of subglacial landforms and sediments now appearing in front of the downwasting ice margin. We have analysed an array of sedimentary properties of basal till from glacial flutings, ploughing marks, an interflute ground moraine, and meandering ridges in order to infer processes of till formation and deformation during the unrecorded surge. Till in flutings and ploughing marks reveals higher mechanical abrasion than in other landforms, but grain size distribution and mineralogy are largely the same everywhere. Micromorphological characteristics are also very similar and comprise ductile and brittle deformation structures, indicating fluctuating porewater pressures. Frequent micrograin fracturing suggests stress concentration along grain bridges during the surge. Till was formed by a combination of lodgement and deformation, caused mainly by clast ploughing. Meandering ridges containing till with water escape structures indicate that surge termination was facilitated by rapid water evacuation from the ice-bed interface through R-type channels. Micromorphological similarity of till found in flutings, ploughing marks, and interflute areas suggests that the resolution of the micromorphological signature is insufficient to constrain the different processes that led to the formation of those landforms. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {[ 1] This study uses seismic receiver functions, surface wave phase velocities, and airborne gravity measurements to investigate the structure of the Transantarctic Mountains ( TAM) and adjacent regions of the Ross Sea ( RS) and East Antarctica ( EA). Forty-one broadband seismometers deployed during the Transantarctic Mountain Seismic Experiment provide new insight into the differences between the TAM, RS, and EA crust and mantle. Combined receiver function and phase velocity inversion with niching genetic algorithms produces accurate crustal and upper mantle seismic velocity models. The crustal thickness increases from 20 +/- 2 km in the RS to a maximum of 40 +/- 2 km beneath the crest of the TAM at 110 +/- 10 km inland. Farther inland, the crust of EA is uniformly 35 +/- 3 km thick over a lateral distance greater than 1300 km. Upper mantle shear wave velocities vary from 4.5 km s(-1) beneath EA to 4.2 km s(-1) beneath RS, with a transition between the two at 100 +/- 50 km inland near the crest of the TAM. The similar to 5 km thick crustal root beneath the TAM has an insufficient buoyant load to explain the entire TAM uplift, suggesting some portion of the uplift may result from flexure associated with a buoyant thermal load in the mantle beneath the edge of the TAM lithosphere.},

  abstract     = {Over the past 10 Ma, the high-relief landscapes of the Colorado Plateau-southern Rocky Mountains region have been shaped by erosional processes. Incision rates have increased in the southern Rocky Mountains, the Colorado River system has been superimposed across buried Laramide structures as it was integrated from the Rocky Mountains to the Gulf of California, the modern Grand Canyon formed, and there has been widespread denudation of the Canyonlands region of the Colorado Plateau. We examine the spatial and temporal distribution of erosion and its associated isostatic rebound since 10 Ma. Erosion estimates come from apatite fission track (AFT) and apatite (U-Th)/He (AHe) thermochronometric studies at 14 sites across the region, including recent AHe data with ages younger than 12 Ma, and from ca. 10 Ma 40Ar/39Ar dated basalt paleosurfaces at 55 locations on the perimeter of the Colorado Plateau and in the southern Rocky Mountains. Estimated eroded thickness is added to modern topography above numerous control points to reconstruct a 10 Ma paleosurface across the region (referenced to modern elevations); this also yields an eroded thickness volume. Erosion has been spatially variable since 10 Ma: we find widespread denudation with as much as 2 km of incision along rivers in the Canyonlands region of Utah, 1-1.5 km of incision along rivers exiting the Rocky Mountains onto the eastern piedmont since 6 Ma, [{\~{}}]1 km removed across the high peaks of the southern Rocky Mountains since 10 Ma, and little net erosion in the Basin and Range. Post-10 Ma flexural isostatic response to the eroded volume is calculated using known variable elastic thickness. This rebound caused much of the Colorado Plateau region to undergo more than 800 m of rock uplift, exceeding 1 km in local areas in the Canyonlands and southwestern Colorado. The Lees Ferry and Glen Canyon areas have been isostatically uplifted {\textgreater}500 m relative to the eastern Grand Canyon and the Tavaputs Plateau has been isostatically uplifted 400 m relative to Browns Park. This differential rock uplift driven by erosional isostasy has created or accentuated many of the features of the modern landscape. This component of rock uplift is "removed" by adding the eroded thickness onto modern topography, then subtracting the calculated rebound. The resulting (pre-erosion and pre-rebound) map provides a model of the 10 Ma landscape, neglecting any tectonic uplift contribution to regional elevations. This model suggests the presence of internal drainages on the Colorado Plateau, that the elevation of the Green River Basin and the Tavaputs Plateau were subequivalent, allowing the Green River to flow southward, and shows high topography in the Rocky Mountains that mimicked modern topography, but with potentially lower relief. Future refinements of both the timing and magnitude of differential erosion and rebound models provide an avenue for improved models for Cenozoic landscape evolution of the region. This paper is an advance over previous studies that focused just on the Colorado Plateau. Here we evaluate isostatic response to erosion in an extended region that includes parts of the Basin and Range, Colorado Plateau, southern Rocky Mountains, and eastern piedmont of the Rocky Mountains. We find that erosion of the southern Rocky Mountains and eastern piedmont is comparable to that of the Colorado Plateau and that the flexural isostatic rebounds of all these regions are coupled and cannot be considered in isolation. Furthermore, we focus on the 10 Ma time frame, rather than the 30 or 70 Ma period of previous researchers, as the key time frame during which the modern landscape rapidly evolved. In addition, the use of AFT and AHe thermochronometric constraints on thicknesses and ages of now-eroded sediments has solved key problems that hampered previous erosion studies. Data and analyses of regional post-10 Ma differential erosion and its resulting differential isostatic rebound provide essential constraints for any viable models for landscape evolution in this classic region.},

  abstract     = {Cosmic Ray Exposure (CRE) dating applied to the active S??chilienne landslide (Romanche valley, Belledonne Massif, French Alps) provides information about its Holocene dynamics from initiation to present day activity. Glacier retreat at 1100??m a.s.l. is estimated at 16.6 ?? 0.6??10Be ka from glacially polished bedrock samples, with total deglaciation of the valley achieved at least by 13.3??ka. Application of the CRE method along vertical profiles sampled with a high spatial resolution of 3??m on the head scarp yields: (1) an initiation of the rock-slope failure at 6.4 ?? 1.4??10Be ka and (2) a continuous rock-slope failure activity with a mean head scarp exposure rate of 0.6??cm/yr. The data suggest an increase of the head scarp exposure rate between 2.3 and 1.0??ka. After this acceleration phase, the exposure rate is similar to that obtained by the present day monitoring data over 20??years in the depletion zone (1.3??cm/yr). Since the failure initiation occurred more than 5400??yr after the total deglaciation of the valley the slope failure does not appear as an immediate consequence of debutressing in the Romanche valley. This result is consistent with studies of other large alpine rockslides in the Alps. Failure initiation of the S??chilienne landslide occurred during the Holocene Climatic Optimum, a hot and wet period. The temperature and precipitation changes of this climatic optimum seem to have a worsening effect at the regional scale to trigger large mass wasting in this glacial alpine valley. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {Using laboratory-derived temperature dependences of the electrical conductivity of mantle minerals coupled with appropriate mixing laws, we determine the bulk conductivity of mantle mineral assemblages for the ternary olivine-orthopyroxene-clinopyroxene (Ol-Opx-Cpx) system. We calculate physical property bounds (Hashin-Shtrikman bounds) as a function of the fraction of different phases present; these limits correspond to the extreme situations where the most conducting phase is either fully interconnected or fully disconnected. The relationships we present between temperature, mineral composition and bulk electrical conductivity allow constraining one of them given the other two. We apply this approach to an area of the North American Cordilleran Intermontane Belt in the Yukon Territory, northern Canada, where xenolith evidence indicates bimodal upper mantle mineral assemblages (harzburgite and lherzolite). This locality coincides spatially with an upper mantle region of low electrical conductivity determined by long period magnetotelluric data. Given the mantle mineral composition and the maximum and minimum bounds on the electrical conductivity, deduced by non-linear model appraisal, we determine the permitted extremal temperature bounds of the Intermontane belt mantle rocks directly below the Moho to a depth of some 80 km. We show that the mantle in this region is at a minimum temperature of 820 ??C and a maximum temperature of 1020 ??C; the latter is some 200 ??C colder than that suggested in a recent interpretation of an observed collocated low velocity zone from a teleseismic survey. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {Densities and elastic properties of solid natural spinel- and garnet-peridotite samples (n = 133) at standard temperature (T) and pressure (P) (STP) conditions were calculated for compositions ranging from Mg{\#} (100 $\lozenge$ Mg/(Mg + Fe)) of 86{\&}{\#}8211;94. The physical properties were used to investigate how natural compositional variations control density and seismic velocity. A corresponding set of compositional derivatives (d/dMg{\#}) of density and seismic velocity is provided. Because the P and T derivatives of elastic moduli are very similar for different compositional end-members of peridotitic minerals, the variation of elastic moduli with Mg{\#} at STP conditions holds at elevated P and T. Increased Mg{\#} leads to a significant increase in V S because of the sensitivity of mineral shear moduli to this parameter (dV S /dMg{\#} = 0.0143 $\pm$ 0.0009 km s{\&}{\#}8722;1). In contrast, the compressional wave velocity (V P ) is insensitive to Mg{\#} and, instead, correlates weakly with increasing olivine abundance at STP conditions. The ratio V P /V S therefore exhibits a significant negative correlation with Mg{\#} (d(V P /V S )/dMg{\#} = {\&}{\#}8722;0.00407 $\pm$ 0.00038). Because the temperature dependency of V P /V S is small ({\textless}{\&}{\#}8764;0.04{\%}/100$\infty$C) compared to the compositional dependency (1.7{\%}/Mg{\#} unit), the variation in V P /V S is a fairly robust measure of compositional variation even when temperature varies. Finally, a new density versus Mg{\#} parameterization is derived. Combined with a compilation of bulk-rock Mg{\#}s of peridotite xenoliths from cratonic lithospheric mantle, it is shown that the intrinsic density of cratonic mantle balances to within error its negative thermal buoyancy imposed by its cooler thermal state relative to upwelling asthenospheric mantle.},

Here we present a new tomographic image beneath Hawaii determined by using simultaneously 10 kinds of seismic phases, P, pP, PP, PcP, Pdiff, PKPab, PKPbc, PKiKP, PKKPab and PKKPbc, extracted from the data set compiled by the International Seismological Center. Of these phases, PKiKP, PKKPab and PKKPbc are, for the first time, attempted to use in the global seismic tomography. Our results show a slow anomaly beneath Hawaii ascending continuously from the CMB to the surface, implying that the Hawaiian plume indeed originates from the CMB. This image is improved notably over the previous results in the whole mantle, particularly in and below the middle mantle, suggesting that later phases, PP, Pdiff, PKP and particularly PKiKP, are of great importance for better imaging the Hawaiian plume. This slow anomaly is considered to be a plume conduit being tilted, which is likely caused by the mantle flow. This indicates that the position of the Hawaiian hotspot on the surface is not stationary, as evidenced by the recent paleomagnetic and numerical modeling studies. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We critically evaluate potential policy-relevant tipping elements in the climate system under anthropogenic forcing, drawing on the pertinent literature and a recent international workshop to compile a short list, and we assess where their tipping points lie. An expert elicitation is used to help rank their sensitivity to global warming and the uncertainty about the underlying physical mechanisms. Then we explain how, in principle, early warning systems could be established to detect the proximity of some tipping points.},

In the situation of dynamical indicator methods, such as seismic velocity, sonic logs, density logs, or drilling exponent methods, intrinsic assumptions and parameter values used provide only a broad statement on the resolution of uplift/erosion events. None of the methods is more accurate, at best, to better than $\pm$ 1 km and likely much worse. For geological model procedures, exemplified by considerations of Airy isostasy and by bed upturning near a salt dome in the Nordkapp Basin of the Barents Sea, the uncertainties are again of the order of $\pm$ 500--1000 m. With thermal indicator procedures, the bulk of the constraint information from available data is needed to determine paleoheat flux with little left over to constrain the erosion, implying a minimum uncertainty of $\pm$ 500 m on erosion determinations. No method seems capable of resolving erosional events to better than a minimum uncertainty of $\pm$ 500 m, and likely no better than $\pm$ 1 km.},

  abstract     = {The Colorado plateau is a large, tectonically intact, physiographic province in the southwestern North American Cordillera that stands at $\sim$1,800-2,000 m elevation and has long been thought to be in isostatic equilibrium. The origin of these high elevations is unclear because unlike the surrounding provinces, which have undergone significant Cretaceous-Palaeogene compressional deformation followed by Neogene extensional deformation, the Colorado plateau is largely internally undeformed. Here we combine new seismic tomography and receiver function images to resolve a vertical high-seismic-velocity anomaly beneath the west-central plateau that extends more than 200 km in depth. The upper surface of this anomaly is seismically defined by a dipping interface extending from the lower crust to depths of 70-90 km. The base of the continental crust above the anomaly has a similar shape, with an elevated Moho. We interpret these seismic structures as a continuing regional, delamination-style foundering of lower crust and continental lithosphere. This implies that Pliocene (2.6-5.3 Myr ago) uplift of the plateau and the magmatism on its margins are intimately tied to continuing deep lithospheric processes. Petrologic and geochemical observations indicate that late Cretaceous-Palaeogene ($\sim$90-40 Myr ago) low-angle subduction hydrated and probably weakened much of the Proterozoic tectospheric mantle beneath the Colorado plateau. We suggest that mid-Cenozoic ($\sim$35-25 Myr ago) to Recent magmatic infiltration subsequently imparted negative compositional buoyancy to the base and sides of the Colorado plateau upper mantle, triggering downwelling. The patterns of magmatic activity suggest that previous such events have progressively removed the Colorado plateau lithosphere inward from its margins, and have driven uplift. Using Grand Canyon incision rates and Pliocene basaltic volcanism patterns, we suggest that this particular event has been active over the past $\sim$6 Myr.},

  abstract     = {An increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration and the resulting global warming are typically associated with a weakening of the thermohaline circulation ( THC) in model scenarios. For the models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project ( CMIP), this weakening shows a significant ( r = 0.62) dependence on the initial THC strength; it is stronger for initially strong overturning. The authors propose a physical mechanism for this phenomenon based on an analysis of additional simulations with the coupled climate models CLIMBER- 2 and CLIMBER- 3 alpha. The mechanism is based on the fact that sea ice cover greatly reduces heat loss from the ocean. The extent of sea ice is strongly influenced by the near- surface atmospheric temperature ( SAT) in the North Atlantic but also by the strength of the THC itself, which transports heat to the convection sites. Consequently, sea ice tends to extend farther south for weaker THC. Initially larger sea ice cover responds more strongly to atmospheric warming; thus, sea ice retreats more strongly for an initially weaker THC. This sea ice retreat tends to strengthen ( i. e., stabilize) the THC because the sea ice retreat allows more oceanic heat loss. This stabilizing effect is stronger for runs with weak initial THC and extensive sea ice cover. Therefore, an initially weak THC weakens less under global warming. In contrast to preindustrial climate, sea ice melting presently plays the role of an external forcing with respect to THC stability.},

  abstract     = {The climate history and dynamics of the Greenland Ice Sheet are studied using a coupled model of the depositional provenance and transport of glacier ice, allowing simultaneous prediction of the detailed isotopic stratigraphy of ice cores at all the major Greenland sites. Adopting a novel method for reconstructing the age-depth relationship, we greatly improve the accuracy of semi-Lagrangian tracer tracking schemes and can readily incorporate an age-dependent ice rheology. The larger aim of our study is to impose new constraints on the glacial history of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Leading sources of uncertainty in the climate and dynamic history are encapsulated in a small number of parameters: the temperature and elevation isotopic sensitivities, the glacial-interglacial precipitation contrast and the effective viscosity of ice in the flow law. Comparing predicted and observed ice layering at ice core sites, we establish plausible ranges for the key model parameters, identify climate and dynamic histories that are mutually consistent and recover the past depositional elevation of ice cores to ease interpretation of their climatic records. With the coupled three-dimensional model of ice dynamics and provenance transport we propose a method to place all the ice core records on a common time scale and use discrepancies to adjust the reconstructed climate history. Analysis of simulated GRIP ice layering and borehole temperature profiles confirms that the GRIP record is sensitive to the dynamic as well as to the climatic history, but not enough to strongly limit speculation on the state of the Greenland Ice Sheet during the Eemian. In contrast, our study indicates that the Dye 3 and Camp Century ice cores are extremely sensitive to ice dynamics and greatly constrain Eemian ice sheet reconstructions. We suggest that the maximum Eemian sea-level contribution of the ice sheet was in the range of 3.5-4.5 m. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), 21 000 yr before present, was the time of maximum land ice extent during the last ice age. A recent simulation of the LGM climate by a state-of-the-art fully coupled global climate model is shown to exhibit strong, steady atmospheric jets and weak transient eddy activity in the Atlantic sector compared to today's climate. In contrast, previous work based on uncoupled atmospheric model simulations has shown that the LGM jets and eddy activity in the Atlantic sector are similar to those observed today, with the main difference being a northeastward extension of their maxima. The coupled model simulation is shown to agree more with paleoclimate proxy records and thus is taken as the more reliable representation of LGM climate. The existence of this altered atmospheric circulation state during LGM in the model has implications for understanding the stability of glacial climates, for the possibility of multiple atmospheric circulation regimes, and for the interpretation of paleoclimate proxy records.

For such purposes netCDF serves as a portable, efficient file format and programming interface, which is popular in numerous scientific application domains. However, the original interface does not provide an efficient mechanism for parallel data storage and access. In this work, we present a new parallel interface for writing and reading netCDF datasets. This interface is derived with minimal changes from the serial netCDF interface but defines semantics for parallel access and is tailored for high performance. The underlying parallel I/O is achieved through MPI-IO, allowing for substantial performance gains through the use of collective I/O optimizations. We compare the implementation strategies and performance with HDF5. Our tests indicate programming convenience and significant I/O performance improvement with this parallel netCDF (PnetCDF) interface.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a brief synthesis of the current state of knowledge on the formation and break-up of the early-Neoproterozoic supercontinent Rodinia, and the subsequent assembly of Gondwanaland. Our discussions are based on both palaeomagnetic constraints and on geological correlations of basement provinces, orogenic histories, sedimentary provenance, the development of continental rifts and passive margins, and the record of mantle plume events. Rodinia assembled through worldwide orogenic events between 1300 Ma and 900 Ma, with all, or virtually all, continental blocks known to exist at that time likely being involved. In our preferred Rodinia model, the assembly process features the accretion or collision of continental blocks around the margin of Laurentia. Like the supercontinent Pangaea, Rodinia lasted about 150 million years after complete assembly. Mantle avalanches, caused by the sinking of stagnated slabs accumulated at the mantle transition zone surrounding the supercontinent, plus thermal insulation by the supercontinent, led to the formation of a mantle superswell (or superplume) beneath Rodinia 40-60 million years after the completion of its assembly. As a result, widespread continental rifting occurred between ca. 825 Ma and 740 Ma, with episodic plume events at ca. 825 Ma, ca. 780 Ma and ca. 750 Ma. Like its assembly, the break-up of Rodinia occurred diachronously. The first major break-up event occurred along the western margin of Laurentia (present coordinates), possibly as early as 750 Ma. Rifting between the Amazonia craton and the southeastern margin of Laurentia started at approximately the same time, but only led to break-up after ca. 600 Ma. By this time most of the western Gondwanan continents had joined together, although the formation of Gondwanaland was not complete until ca. 530 Ma. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {This review paper presents a set of revised global palaeogeographic maps for the 825-540. Ma interval using the latest palaeomagnetic data, along with lithological information for Neoproterozoic sedimentary basins. These maps form the basis for an examination of the relationships between known glacial deposits, palaeolatitude, positions of continental rifting, relative sea-level changes, and major global tectonic events such as supercontinent assembly, breakup and superplume events. This analysis reveals several fundamental palaeogeographic features that will help inform and constrain models for Earth's climatic and geodynamic evolution during the Neoproterozoic. First, glacial deposits at or near sea level appear to extend from high latitudes into the deep tropics for all three Neoproterozoic ice ages (Sturtian, Marinoan and Gaskiers), although the Gaskiers interval remains very poorly constrained in both palaeomagnetic data and global lithostratigraphic correlations. Second, continental sedimentary environments were dominant in epicratonic basins within Rodinia ({\textgreater}. 825. Ma to ca. 750. Ma), possibly resulting from both plume/superplume dynamic topography and lower sea-level due to dominantly old oceanic crust. This was also the case at ca. 540. Ma, but at that time the pattern reflects widespread mountain ranges formed during the assembly of Gondwanaland and increasing mean age of global ocean crust. Third, deep-water environments were dominant during the peak stage of Rodinia break-up between ca. 720. Ma and ca. 580. Ma, likely indicating higher sea level due to increased rate of production of newer oceanic crust, plus perhaps the effect of continents drifting away from a weakening superplume. Finally, there is no clear association between continental rifting and the distribution of glacial strata, contradicting models that restrict glacial influence to regions of continental uplift. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

In particular, we examine changes in the shape of glacial cycles and the power of obliquity and precession response in benthic ??18O. When the exponential trend in ??18O variance is removed, its spectral power exhibits strong, proportional responses to amplitude modulations in orbital forcing over most of the Plio-Pleistocene. Precession responses correlate with modulations in forcing for the last 5 Myr, but 41-kyr response is sensitive to obliquity modulation only before 1.4 Myr. Where responses are sensitive to modulations in forcing, we demonstrate that glacial cycles are orbitally forced rather than being self-sustained or paced by orbital changes. The shapes of glacial cycles have several nonlinear properties, which may be indicative of glacial-interglacial differences in climate sensitivity or response time. The "saw-tooth" asymmetry of glacial cycles first appears shortly after the onset of major northern hemisphere glaciation, and the relative duration of interglacial stages decreases at 1.4 Myr. Collectively, trends in the shape of glacial cycles and the sensitivity of ??18O to obliquity and precession are suggestive of major transitions in climate dynamics at approximately 2.5 and 1.4 Myr but show no significant change associated with the appearance of strong 100-kyr cycles during the mid-Pleistocene transition. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract     = {Time-frequency analysis is an important technology in seismic data processing and interpretation. To localize frequency content in time, we have developed a novel method for computing a time-frequency map for nonstationary signals using an iterative inversion framework. We calculated time-varying Fourier coefficients by solving a least-squares problem that uses regularized nonstationary regression. We defined the time-frequency map as the norm of time-varying coefficients. Time-varying average frequency of the seismic data can also be estimated from the time-frequency map calculated by our method. We tested the method on benchmark synthetic signals and compared it with the well-known S-transform. Two field data examples showed applications of the proposed method for delineation of sand channels and for detection of low-frequency anomalies.},

  abstract     = {We use inverse models of mantle convection to explore the vertical evolution of the Colorado Plateau. By satisfying multiple constraints (seismic tomography, stratigraphy in the western United States and Great Plains, and other structural and volcanic data adjacent to the plateau), the model provides predictions on the continuous history of Colorado Plateau vertical motion since 100 Ma. With the arrival of the flat-lying Farallon slab, dynamic subsidence swept from west to east over the plateau and reached a maximum ca. 86 Ma. Two stages of uplift followed the removal of the Farallon slab below the plateau: one in the latest Cretaceous and the other in the Eocene with a cumulative uplift of $\sim$1.2 km. Both the descent of the slab and buoyant upwellings raised the plateau to its current elevation during the Oligocene. A locally thick plateau lithosphere enhances the coupling to the upper mantle so that the plateau has a higher topography with sharp edges. The models predict that the plateau tilted downward to the northeast before the Oligocene, caused by northeast-trending subduction of the Farallon slab, and that this northeast tilting diminished and reversed to the southwest during the Miocene in response to buoyant upwellings.},

Exposure age measurements of bedrock indicate that the elevation of the ice surface in the Grove Mountains region subsequently rose at about mid-Pliocene to at least 200 m higher than today's levels. The ice surface then progressively lowered, with some minor fluctuations. Middle to Late Pleistocene exposure ages found on the lowest samples, at the ice/bedrock contact line, indicate a long period with ice surface elevations kept at the current level or complex fluctuation history during the Quaternary Epoch. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We design a threshold value that controls the filter window according to characteristics of signal and random, spike-like noise. In view of the relationship between seismic data and the threshold value, we chose median filters with different time-varying filter windows to eliminate random, spike-like noise. When comparing our method with other common methods, e.g., the band-pass filter and stationary MF, we found that the TVMF strikes a balance between eliminating random noise and protecting useful information.

  abstract      = {The Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains (GSM), located near the center of East Antarctica, are the highest feature within the East Antarctic highlands and have been investigated seismically for the first time during the 2007/2008 International Polar Year by the Gamburtsev Mountains Seismic Experiment. Using data from a network of 26 broadband seismic stations and body wave tomography, the P and S wave velocity structure of the upper mantle beneath the GSM and adjacent regions has been examined. Tomographic images produced from teleseismic P and S phases reveal several large-scale, small amplitude anomalies (Vp=1.0{\%}, Vs=2.0{\%}) in the upper 250 km of the mantle. The lateral distributions of these large-scale anomalies are similar in both the P and S wave velocity models and resolution tests show that they are well resolved. Velocity anomalies indicate slower, thinner lithosphere beneath the likely Meso- or Neoproterozoic Polar Subglacial Basin and faster, thicker lithosphere beneath the likely Archean/Paleoproterozoic East Antarctic highlands. Within the region of faster, thicker lithosphere, a lower amplitude (Vp=0.5{\%}, Vs=1.0{\%}) slow to fast velocity pattern is observed beneath the western flank of the GSM, suggesting a suture between two lithospheric blocks possibly of similar age. These findings point to a Precambrian origin for the high topography of the GSM, corroborating other studies invoking a long-lived highland landscape in central East Antarctica, as opposed to uplift caused by Permian/Cretaceous rifting or Cenozoic magmatism. The longevity of the GSM makes them geologically unusual; however, plausible analogs exist, such as the 550 Ma Petermann Ranges in central Australia. Additional uplift may have occurred by the reactivation of pre-existing faults, for example, during the Carboniferous-Permian collision of Gondwana and Laurussia.},

  abstract     = {When modelling the Antarctic ice sheet, the velocity of the ice flow is linked to its temperature. Depending on the thermal rate, the flow rate may vary between deformation and sliding. In this study, we focus on the geothermal flux because it is the least well-known component of the heat equation, and because it constrains the temperature at the bottom of the ice sheet. We used available geological data to build a map of the geothermal flux, which was found to increase from 51 mW/m2 in East Antarctica to 68 mW/m2 in West Antarctica. These values were integrated in the computation of a basal temperature map. The available map of hydrological networks clearly shows more melted areas in West Antarctica than in the earlier results. So we suggest that the model should be forced with higher geothermal flux values, over 85 mW/m2 in this sector. This increase is in good agreement with published results which found a geothermal flux three times higher in West Antarctica. Finally, we computed the bottom melt rate over the ice sheet area which has a mean value of 3.5 mm/yr resulting in a lost of melted ice equal to 1{\%} of the total mass balance. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {The margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet retreated rapidly during the first few thousand years of the Holocene. During this period of relative warmth, known as the Holocene thermal maximum, ice core records identify a significant short-lived cooling event at approximately 8.4-8.0 ka cal. yr BP (the 'GH-8.2 event') associated with a 5-7 ??C fall in mean annual air temperature over the centre of the ice sheet. In this paper we constrain the history of the ice sheet margin in Disko Bugt (west Greenland) and that of a major ice stream, Jakobshavns Isbrae, during the early Holocene, which incorporates the interval of the GH-8.2 event. Our work is based on a new relative sea-level curve and minimum age estimates for the timing of deglaciation from two field sites, combined with a review of previously published research from the study area. We identify important differences in the chronology of ice margin recession during the early Holocene, most noticeably, the margin of Jakobshavns Isbrae retreated well inland of the adjacent ice sheet at this time. We conclude that the early Holocene 'Fjord Stade' moraines in Disko Bugt do not record a uniform ice sheet margin response to the GH-8.2 event. Rather, these moraines are diachronous and formed between c. 10-8 ka cal. yr BP, their age varying as a function of the interplay between topography and ice sheet/ice stream dynamics. We hypothesise that one cause for the lack of an identifiable response to the GH-8.2 event is because topographic controls dominated ice sheet behaviour at this time. In lowland areas, any increase in ice sheet mass balance was probably associated with an increase in calving rather than any major advance of a grounded ice sheet margin. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract      = {Numerous volcanoes exist in Marie Byrd Land, a highland region of West Antarctica. High heat flow through the crust in this region may influence the stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Volcanic activity progressed from north to south in the Executive Committee mountain range between the Miocene and Holocene epochs, but there has been no evidence for recent magmatic activity. Here we use a recently deployed seismic network to show that in 2010 and 2011, two swarms of seismic activity occurred at 25--40 km depth beneath subglacial topographic and magnetic highs, located 55 km south of the youngest subaerial volcano in the Executive Committee Range. We interpret the swarm events as deep long-period earthquakes based on their unusual frequency content. Such earthquakes occur beneath active volcanoes, are caused by deep magmatic activity and, in some cases, precede eruptions. We also use radar profiles to identify a prominent ash layer in the ice overlying the seismic swarm. Located at 1,400 m depth, the ash layer is about 8,000 years old and was probably sourced from the nearby Mount Waesche volcano. Together, these observations provide strong evidence for ongoing magmatic activity and demonstrate that volcanism continues to migrate southwards along the Executive Committee Range. Eruptions at this site are unlikely to penetrate the 1.2 to 2-km-thick overlying ice, but would generate large volumes of melt water that could significantly affect ice stream flow.},

  abstract     = {Alluvial, fluvial, and organic deposits of the last interglaciation are exposed along numerous river terraces in northeast Siberia. Although chronological control is often poor, the paleobotanical data suggest range extensions of up to 1000 km for the primary tree species. These data also indicate that boreal communities of the last interglaciation were similar to modern ones in composition, but their distributions were displaced significantly to the north-northwest. Inferences about climate of this period suggest that mean July temperatures were warmer by 4 to 8{$^{\circ}$}C, and seasonal precipitation was slightly greater. Mean January temperatures may have been severely cooler than today (up to 12{$^{\circ}$}C) along the Arctic coast, but similar or slightly warmer than present in other areas. The direction and magnitude of change in July temperatures agree with Atmospheric General Circulation Models, but the 126,000-year-B.P. model results also suggest trends opposite to the paleobotanical data, with simulated cooler winter temperatures and drier conditions than present during the climatic optimum.},

  abstract     = {Krundalen, a valley occupied by three eastern outlet glaciers of the Jostedalsbre ice cap, contains three groups of moraines, two of which are outside the dated neoglacial (Little Ice Age, LIA) limits. Exposures in the outermost moraine ridge display three sedimentary units. Detailed sedimentological analyses reveal that the lower two units formed during a temporary stillstand of the ice margin inferred to have occurred because of a topographically controlled stabilization of the ice margin during glacier retreat following the Younger Dryas. A climatically controlled readvance during which the upper unit was deposited, partly eroding pre-existing sediments, followed. Continuation of this readvance led to the whole sequence being pushed up to form the present moraine. The sedimentological results including clast shape measurements imply a temperate glacier thermal regime at the time of moraine formation. The glacial palaeoenvironment was characterized by frequent oscillations and an abundant supply of glaciogenic sediment. The age of this landform can at present not be determined by numerical dating. However, the moraine is likely to have been formed in the early Holocene, during Jondal Event 2 (JE) from c. 10 55010 450 cal. yr BP. The average equilibrium-line altitude lowering calculated for this event is c. 440 m, 340 m for the Erdalen Event 1 (EE, 10 10010 050 cal. yr BP) moraines and c. 190 m for the LIA moraines farther upvalley. Precipitation calculated for these stages compared with present values is 160175{\%} (JE), 165175{\%} (EE) and 110{\%} (LIA). Summer air temperatures were slightly higher than todays during the JE, much higher during the EE and are indistinguishable from present values during the LIA. The existence of a potential JE-equivalent and the extent of the EE are reported and used for glacier reconstruction for the first time in Krundalen. The sedimentological data implies that the JE did not simply consist of a single readvance but was more complex. It is argued that glacial sedimentology linked with methods of glacier reconstruction provides a powerful tool to gain insights into the dynamics and functioning of formerly glaciated areas.},

Clast shapes indicate dominant englacial and supraglacial transport with a smaller subglacial component. Emplacement of material is inferred to have been through meltout along flowlines due to the relatively uniform and continuous debris cover along the glacier margins; no evidence of thrusting has been found. Degradation of all three belts is rapid and involves debris flows at unstable placese.g., the margins of meltwater channels. Resultant exposure of underlying ice initiates or accelerates melting, thereby leading to further debris flows. Hence, once degradation starts, a self-reinforcing cycle that removes material from the glacier commences. Landform preservation potential on millennial time scales in a high-arctic, continuous permafrost environment is thus limited. This work has implications for the interpretation of Pleistocene landform associations that use modern analogues from Svalbard.},

The Pleistocene stratigraphy in northern Finland provides clear evidence that northern Sweden must have been covered by ice in pre-Holstenian time. In Swedish Lapland two Weichselian interstadials have been identified. They were called the Per{\"{a}}pohjola and T{\"{a}}rend{\"{o}} Interstadials, then using the Finnish name for the first-mentioned stage. Correlation with the North-European Bromp and Odderade interstadials appears likely, although no finite ages have been obtained from the Swedish sites. This means that they correspond to Marine Isotope Substages (MIS) 5c and 5a, respectively. Consequently, the stadials between them and separating them from the Eemian correspond to the cold phases 5d and 5b.},

  abstract     = {The Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary interval is exposed over 12 km in the coastal cliff, Stevns Klint, Denmark. An important lowermost Danian hardground has been interpreted as an originally horizontal marine abrasion surface. Its present elevation varies, from a few metres below, to about 35 m above sea level. This relief has traditionally been considered as resulting from late or post-Danian Laramide folding. New seismic profiles offshore Stevns Klint show, however, that the Base-Chalk reflector is not folded, is remarkably planar and has a gentle northward dip. Thus, the folding hypothesis cannot be upheld. Seismic stratigraphic analysis of the Chalk Group necessitates a fundamental revision of general ideas of chalk deposition. A highly irregular sea-floor topography was formed at many levels, and includes broad valleys, ridges, channels, drifts and mounds. A system of major WNW-ESE-oriented valleys and ridges can be traced into the succession exposed in Stevns Klint and further inland where it corresponds to the relief of the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary. The marked topographic elements of the chalk sea floor are elongate, with a WNW orientation roughly parallel to the axis of the Danish Basin and to the Sorgenfrei-Tornquist Zone forming the NE border of the basin. The sea-floor relief undoubtedly reflects the influence of strong contour-parallel bottom currents. The Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary succession at Stevns Klint was thus developed on an underlying sea-floor topographic relief of about 40 m. Recognition of the highly irregular, current-influenced topography of the late Cretaceous sea floor stands in marked contrast to the conventional picture of quiet pelagic deposition of the chalk.},

The study area comprises a small glacier (400-1000 m a.s.l.), on the south side of Adventfjorden (78{$^{\circ}$} 11$\prime$N) that was polythermal during the LIA and turned into a passively down-wasting cold-based ice-mass prior to 1936. Reconstruction of the formation and decay of ice-cored moraines and the shifting courses of glacial meltwater shows that sediment transport during deglaciation occurred in a slow, stepwise fashion with glacial landforms and sediments being slowly replaced by fluvial morphologies and slope-waste products. The key controlling factors are melting rates, aspect and surface gradients. A low melting rate and slow reworking of glacial debris promote the formation of a lag or "pavement" on low-gradient surfaces and debrisfall deposits along steeper slopes. Both products easily may be misinterpreted as a result of weathering and non-glacial processes. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {Abstract  Study of a Holocene fan delta in Adventfjorden, Spitsbergen, provides new insight into the nature of high-arctic coastal sedimentation and deglaciation dynamics. The fjord-side, gravelly Gilbert-type fan delta began to form at the local marine limit c. 10ka BP, supplied seasonally with sediment by meltwater from a cirque glacier left behind by the retreating Late Weichselian ice sheet. Relative sea level had fallen by 63m, and the fan delta reached a radius of c. 1km by 6ka BP, when the relic glacier eventually melted down and fluvial activity declined. A strong influence of marine processes is recorded by the fan-delta foreset facies, overlain by alluvium. Supplied with sediment by longshore drift, the fan-delta front continued to advance at a lower rate, while relative sea level fell further by 5m and ceased to fall around 5.4ka BP. The following transgression was countered by longshore sediment supply until 4.7ka BP, when the delta-front beach aggraded and a spit platform began to climb onto the delta plain, recording a relative sea-level rise of 4m. The subsequent regression was initially non-depositional, with the relative sea level falling by {\textgreater} 4m in 200years, outpacing fluvial supply, and the re-emerging fan delta being swept by longshore currents. A regressive beach began to form c. 4.3ka BP, while relative sea level gradually reached its present-day position. The feeder braided stream was wandering across the delta plain during this time, but incised once the fan-delta shoreline began to retreat by wave erosion and turned into a receding modern escarpment. The stream has since been adjusting its profile by gradually eroding the pre-existing alluvium and distributing the coarse sediment supplied from catchment slopes by debrisflows and snow avalanches. Modern snowflows have also spread debris onto the abandoned fan surface. The erosional retreat of the fan delta has been accompanied by lateral shoreline accretion on both its sides. The study has important regional implications and demonstrates that Holocene fan deltas can provide a valuable record of the deglaciation history in high-arctic terrains, where glacial deposits are scarcely preserved on land.},

  abstract     = {Lavas from several major bathymetric highs in the eastern Indian Ocean that are likely to have formed as Early to Middle Cretaceous manifestations of the Kerguelen hotspot are predominantly tholeiitic; so too are glass shards from Eocene to Paleocene volcanic ash layers on Broken Ridge, which are believed to have come from eruptions on the Ninetyeast Ridge. The early dominance of tholeiitic compositions contrasts with the more recent intraplate, alkalic volcanism of the Kerguelen Archipelago. Isotopic and incompatible-element ratios of the plateau lavas are distinct from those of Indian mid-ocean ridge basalts; their Nd, Sr, 207Pb204Pb and 208Pb204Pb isotopic ratios overlap with but cover a much wider range than measured for more recent oceanic products of the Kerguelen hotspot (including the Ninetyeast Ridge) or, indeed, oceanic lavas from any other hotspot in the world. Samples from the Naturaliste Plateau and ODP Site 738 on the southern tip of the Kerguelen Plateau are particularly noteworthy, with ??{\{}lunate{\}}Nd(T) = - 13 to -7, (87Sr86Sr)T=0.7090 to 0.7130 and high 207Pb204Pb relative to 206Pb204Pb. In addition, the low-??{\{}lunate{\}}Nd(T) Naturaliste Plateau samples are elevated in SiO2 ({\textgreater} 54 wt{\%}). In contrast to "DUPAL" oceanic islands such as the Kerguelen Archipelago, Pitcairn and Tristan da Cunha, the plateau lavas with extreme isotopic characteristics also have relative depletions in Nb and Ta (e.g., Th Ta, La Nb {\textgreater} primitive mantle values); the lowest ??{\{}lunate{\}}Nd(T) and highest Th Ta and La Nb values occur at sites located closest to rifted continental margins. Accepting a Kerguelen plume origin for the plateau lavas, these characteristics probably reflect the shallow-level incorporation of continental lithosphere in either the head of the early Kerguelen plume or in plume-derived magmas, and suggest that the influence of such material diminished after the period of plateau construction. Contamination of asthenosphere with the type of material affecting Naturaliste Plateau and Site 738 magmatism appears unlikely to be the cause of low-206Pb04Pb Indian mid-ocean ridge basalts. Finally, because isotopic data for the plateaus do not cluster or form converging arrays in isotope-ratio plots, they provide no evidence for either a quickly evolving, positive ??{\{}lunate{\}}Nd, relatively high-206Pb204Pb plume composition, or a plume source dominated by mantle with ??{\{}lunate{\}}Nd of -3 to ??? 0. ?? 1995.},

The strong glacial erosion by the last large ice sheets has led to scarcity of old Quaternary deposits on land in Norway. Therefore the oldest glacial history of Norway has to be deciphered from deposits in the border zone of the Scandinavian ice sheet to the south, in Denmark-Germany-Netherlands-The North Sea, and to the west, on the Norwegian continental shelf and in the deep Norwegian Sea. The reconstruction of the Late Weichselian maximum and the Younger Dryas ice sheets is discussed in the chapter in detail. The Younger Dryas moraines constitute the backbone of reconstructions of the deglaciation history of Norway, and indeed of all of Fennoscandia. End moraines from this period have been mapped more or less continuously around the entire former Scandinavian Ice Sheet. One of the Younger Dryas moraines in southern Norway was interpreted as an end moraine by the Norwegian geologist Esmark already in 1824, and that was the first time it was concluded that there had been a major ice sheet over Scandinavia.},

In this paper, we describe many well-dated (by conventional and AMS 14C methods and optically stimulated luminescence) sedimentary sequences in the controversial area of Northern Russia. The sequences discussed are not covered by till, and yet all predate the LGM. The deposits consist mostly of aeolian or lacustrine, easily deformable soft silt and fine sand. Two sites feature frozen mammoth carcasses and three sites contain Palaeolithic artefacts and mammalian bones. We emphasise that these formations show no sign of having been overridden by an ice sheet. At several sites, deposition of aeolian sediments and formation of ice wedges took place during the LGM time span. These observations present unambiguous proof that the Barents-Kara Ice Sheet did not cover mainland Russia during LGM, with a possible exception for the northern tip of the Taimyr Peninsula. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract     = {The extent of Late Weichselian glaciation in Arctic Russia remains a problem. Our model of 1995-1998 suggests a continuous and long-lived ice sheet centered on the Kara Sea. Other reconstructions suggest a smaller and "diachronous" glaciation. The vast majority of dates support the model of restricted glaciation. We show that these dates are inconsistent with the geologic record of ice flow across the Kara-Barents divide, with second-order glacial geology of Kola Peninsula, and with evidence for glacial surges. They are also inconsistent with Late Weichselian climate of the Arctic, with Eurasian continental paleohydrology, including meltwater drainage systems, cataclysmic megafloods, major transgressions of the Caspian Sea, and with the entire paleogeographic context of northern Eurasia. We believe that, due to impeded ventilation of the Pleistocene Arctic Ocean, these dates are often too old, and that recycling and contamination of the samples would also contribute to the dating errors. Destructive impacts of late-glacial ice-sheet surges and megafloods upon the Arctic glacial sequences would also aggravate the situation. By ignoring the dates until these problems are addressed, we find that the field evidence supports continuous glaciation of Arctic Russia at the LGM, and that the resulting ice sheet was part of an Arctic Ice Sheet that included an ice shelf in the Arctic Ocean and ice sheets in Greenland and North America. We present 3-D reconstructions of the Arctic Ice Sheet and, with an enlarged Antarctic Ice Sheet, we show that the ice volume is equivalent to an LGM sea level that was 130-135 m lower than at present. The reconstructions depict the Arctic Ice Sheet before and after massive thawing of the bed that allows partial gravitational collapse of the overlying ice, with a minimal change in ice volume.},

We conclude that the glaciation was more extensive. Terraces that were postulated to have been ice-free are covered by a thin, late Weichselian till. Sudden drop in the marine limit and basal radiocarbon dates of raised glaciomarine sediments demonstrates that the glaciers in the main fjords, Isfjorden and Van Mijenfjorden, terminated west (outside) of the fjord mouths. Basal radiocarbon dates from glaciomarine clay above till in cores from the continental shelf west of Spitsbergen yielded ages of about 12,500 yr B.P., from which we conclude that the ice extended to the shelf edge. Based on the extent of amino acid diagenesis in radiocarbon-dated molluscs, the duration of the maximum extension of the late Weichselian glaciation was short, certainly less than 10,000 years. During the ice-free period preceding that glaciation, at least back to 40,000 yr B.P., the glaciers on Svalbard were not significantly larger than at present, as shown by marine deposits close to the glacier snouts. Many radiocarbon dates place deglaciation of the outer coast at about 12,500 yr B.P. At about 10,000 yr B.P., the rest of the archipelago rapidly became ice-free. ?? 1992.},

In our opinion (Mangerud et al. 1984) it is now demonstrated that a relatively large ice-sheet complex existed over most of Svalbard and large parts (if not all) of the Barents Sea. One of the main arguments for a large ice sheet is the pattern of uplift, including the 9,800 B.P. date on the 100 m shoreline in Kong Karls Land (Salvigsen 1981). Important unresolved problems include how large that ice sheet was, the location of the different ice domes and ice fronts, the age and duration of the glacial maximum, and the deglaciation history. We will here report on these problems bringing some results from the Van Mijenfjorden and Isfjorden area (Fig. 1); a more comprehensive paper is in preparation.},

We present reservoir ages from dating 21 whales collected 1860-1901 and recalculating dates of 23 molluscs collected 1857-1926. Most of the whales were caught along the coast of Norway, but one is from France and one from Iceland. We assume the former mainly lived in the North and equatorial Atlantic and in the Norwegian Sea. Whales feed only on pelagic organisms and will provide the reservoir age for the open ocean surface water. However, they travel long distances and will integrate the reservoir ages of the different water masses along their way. Molluscs (dated from Norway, Spitsbergen and Arctic Canada) are stationary and monitor the sea water passing their dwelling site, but some also take up carbon from particulate food or sediment pore water. Coastal water also often contains some continental carbon. We present two different views on how to analyze and interpret the data. Mangerud recommends to use reservoir ages based on a combination of the whale and mollusc dates, i.e. 380$\pm$30 and 360$\pm$30 yr relative to Intcal04 and British oak, respectively, and a $\Delta$R value of 20$\pm$30 for the surface water in the N-Atlantic and Norwegian Sea. Bondevik and Gulliksen maintain that the reservoir age-and $\Delta$R-along the Norwegian coast is latitude dependant, with $\Delta$R-values increasing from -3$\pm$22 in the South to 105$\pm$24 at Spitsbergen. Whales, reflecting North Atlantic open ocean surface water have lower $\Delta$R (7$\pm$11) than most molluscs. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Six samples from large boulders on the moraine yielded a mean age of 21.5??2.3 (std. error) kyr. The distinct semicircular Usa Moraine is located beyond the western flank of the Urals. Boulders in the valley between the Chernov and Usa moraines yielded some spread in 10Be-ages, but four out of seven yielded ages 50-60 kyr. We conclude that the Usa and Chernov Moraines represent the maximum glacier extent during Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 4 and 2, respectively. The exceptionally small extent of the LGM glacier is explained with a dry LGM climate, but also with the fact that present day cirque glaciers in the Polar Urals are extremely favoured by topographical factors such as leeward accumulation and shadowing mountain walls, advantages which decrease when the glaciers grow. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract     = {Novaya Zemlya was covered by the eastern part of the Barents--Kara ice sheet during the glacial maximum of marine isotope stage 2 (MIS 2). We obtained 14C ages on 37 samples of mollusc shells from various sites on the islands. Most samples yielded ages in the range of 48--26 14C Ky. Such old samples are sensitive to contamination by young 14C, and therefore their reliability was assessed using replicate analyses and amino acid geochronology. The extent of aspartic acid racemization (Asp D/L) indicates that many of the 14C ages are correct, whereas some are minimum ages only. The results indicate that a substantial part of Novaya Zemlya was ice-free about 35--27 14C Kya, and probably even earlier. Corresponding shorelines up to {\textgreater}140 m a.s.l. indicate a large Barents--Kara ice sheet during early MIS 3. These results are consistent with findings from Svalbard and northern Russia: in both places a large MIS 4/3 Barents--Kara ice sheet is postulated to have retreated about 50 Kya, followed by an ice-free interstadial that lasted until up to ca. 25 Kya. The duration of the MIS 2 glaciation in Novaya Zemlya was calculated by applying the D/L values to a kinetic equation for Asp racemization. This indicates that the islands were ice covered for less than 3000 years if the basal temperature was 0oC, and for less than 10 000 years if it was -5oC.},

These moraines rest on top of a marine shoreline radiocarbon-dated to about 11 200 14C yr BP and demonstrate that the AD-1900 moraines show the maximum glacier extent since late Aller{\o}d time. This means that Scottbreen was smaller during the Younger Dryas than at AD 1900, in contrast with glaciers on mainland western Europe, which were all much larger during the Younger Dryas. The explanation is probably starvation of precipitation on western Spitsbergen during the Younger Dryas. In contrast, ice sheets and glaciers in Spitsbergen reacted more or less in concert with glaciers in western Europe, during the global Last Glacial Maximum and the Little Ice Age.},

Glacial elements show that it was; deposited by the Kara Ice Sheet, and in the west, by the Barents Ice Sheet. The Markhida moraine overlies Eemian marine sediments, and is therefore of Weichselian age. Distal to the moraine are Eemian marine sediments and three Palaeolithic sites with many C-14 dates in the range 16-37 ka not covered by till, proving that it represents the maximum ice sheet extension during the Weichselian. The Late Weichselian ice limit of M. G. Grosswald is about 400 km (near the Urals more than 700 km) too far south. Shorelines of ice damned Lake Komi, probably dammed by the ice sheet ending at the Markhida line, predate 37 ka. We conclude that the Markhida line is of Middle/Early Weichselian age, implying that no ice sheet reached this part of Northern. Russia during the Late Weichselian. This age is supported by a series of C-14 and OSL dates inside the Markhida Line all of {\textgreater}45 ka. Two moraine loops protrude south of the Markhida line; the Laya-Adzva and Rogavaya moraines. These moraines are covered by Lake Komi sediments, and many C-14 dates on mammoth bones inside the moraines are 26-37 ka. The morphology indicates that the moraines are of Weichselian age, but a Saalian age cannot be excluded. No post-glacial emerged marine shorelines are found along the Barents Sea coast north of the Markhida line.},

The cores were collected in closed basins, where continuous deposition is expected. The marine sediment in the studied cores is up to 8 m thick and consists of bioturbated clay and silt. Radiocarbon dates on shells from the base of the marine sequence suggest that glacial retreat from the lake basin occurred around 12,500BP. This is more than a thousand years older than basal shell dates from raised marine sediments on the slopes above the lake. Typical ice proximal litbofacies were not identified in the cores. stratigraphic record indicates both a rapid glacial retreat and that no younger glacial re-advances occurred. During the Younger Dryas local glaciers on western Svalbard were smaller than during the Little Ice Age.

  abstract     = {Depositional environments, stratigraphic relations, and 35 new AMS 14C dates at Cape Shpindler, Yugorski Peninsula, help constrain the late Pleistocene glacial and environmental history of the southern Kara Sea region. Fifteen- to fifty-meter-high coastal exposures reveal a complex package of shallow marine, fluvial, glacial, and postglacial deposits, and are documented here in a 19-km-long cross-section and eight vertical sections. The shallow marine (Unit A), estuarine or prodeltaic (Unit B), and fluvio-deltaic (Unit C) deposits contain an interglacial molluscan fauna, yield radiocarbon dates greater than 40 ka, and may correspond with a regional sea-level highstand during the Eemian. These units are overlain by a diamicton (Unit D), and are pervasively deformed by folds and low- to high-angle faults into a stacked glaciotectonic accretionary complex. The diamicton (Unit D) is a subglacial till, and associated massive ground ice with deformed debris bands (Unit E) appears to be relict glacier ice. Glaciotectonic structures document both southward- and northward-directed glacier movement. Above the till and associated glaciotectonic horizons lies 0- to 11-m-thick postglacial deposits of peatland, eolian, fluvial, and primarily lacustrine origin (Unit F). The postglacial deposits yield radiocarbon ages of 12.8 to 0.8 ka. Thus, at least one regional glaciation is prominently represented in the stratigraphy, and occurred probably after the Eemian but before 12.8 ka. We infer that the bulk of the glacial record corresponds with southward advance by an early Weichselian Kara Sea Ice Sheet, in agreement with other recently documented, regional records from Yamal Peninsula and the Pechora Basin. The timing and source of northward-directed glacier ice are less well constrained. Across the broad expanse of the Eurasian Arctic, Quaternary stratigraphy is still sparsely documented. The new data from Cape Shpindler fill a spatial gap in paleoenvironmental research. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {Ageneral linear theory describes the extension of the convolutional method to nonstationary processes. This theory can apply any linear, nonstationary filter, with ar- bitrary timeandfrequency variation, in the time,Fourier, or mixed domains. The filter application equations and the expressions to move the filter between domains are all ordinary Fourier transforms or generalized convo- lutional integrals. Nonstationary transforms such as the wavelet transform are not required.There aremanypos- sible applications of this theory including: the one-way propagation of waves through complex media, time mi- gration, normal moveout removal, time-variant filtering, and forward and inverse Q filtering. Two complementary nonstationary filters are devel- oped by generalizing the stationary convolution integral. The first, called nonstationary convolution, corresponds to the linear superposition of scaled impulse responses of a nonstationary filter. The second, called nonstation- ary combination, does not correspond to such a super- position but is shown to be a linear process capable of achieving arbitrarily abrupt temporal variations in the output frequency spectrum. Both extensions have sta- tionary convolution as a limitingformand, in the discrete case, can be formulated as matrix operations. Fourier transformation shows that both filter types are nonstationary filter integrals in the Fourier domain as well. This result is a generalization of the convolution theorem for stationary signals because, as the filter be- comes stationary in one domain, the integral in the other domain collapses to a scalar multiplication. For discrete signals, stationary filters are a matrix multiplication of the input signal spectrum by a diagonal spectral matrix, while nonstationary filters require off-diagonal terms. For quasi-stationary filters, a computational advantage is obtained by computing only the significant terms near the diagonal. Unlike stationary theory, a mixed domain of time and frequency is also possible. In this context, the nonstation- ary filter is applied simultaneously with the transform from time to frequency or the reverse. Nonstationary convolution becomes a generalized forward Fourier in- tegral and nonstationary combination is a generalized inverse Fourier integral.},

  abstract     = {A chronology for the Last Glacial Maximum based on cosmogenic exposure dating in the Pangnirtung Fjord area, eastern Baffin Island, Arctic Canada, is at odds with many decades of land-based, glacial stratigraphic research. Most previous chronologies focused primarily on relative weathering criteria and suggested that ice extent was restricted during the late Wisconsinan (ca. 24-8 ka). In contrast, by directly dating glacial features, we conclude that late Wisconsinan ice was far more extensive than previously believed. There are 36 gneissic boulders and 8 samples of ice-molded gneissic bedrock that yield late Wisconsinan 10Be and 26Al exposure ages for the last glaciation of Pangnirtung Fjord. The prominent Duval moraines, which were previously interpreted to represent a significant early Wisconsinan (100-60 ka) ice advance on southern Cumberland Peninsula, were actually deposited between 24 and 9 ka. Two boulders from a raised glaciomarine delta, stratigraphically related to the Duval moraines, date to about 10 ka. Two recessional moraines and striated bedrock along Pangnirtung Fjord, as well as erratics on the floor of the Kolik River valley, a tributary to Pangnirtung Fjord, indicate that deglaciation began between 12 and 9 ka. In situ produced 10Be and 26Al abundances indicate that ice filled Pangnirtung Fjord for about 15 k.y. (either continuously or intermittently) prior to 10 ka, which is compatible with 14C chronologies for adjacent Cumberland Sound. Thus, our data support other recent studies that suggest the northern and southern margins of the Laurentide ice sheet were generally in phase during the latest Wisconsinan, contrary to earlier interpretations.},

  abstract     = {The occurrence of a seismic series in Deception Island volcano (Antarctica), composed of hundreds of local volcano-tectonic earthquakes, has permitted us to study the seismic attenuation of such a volcanic environment in the short-distance and high-frequency range. This study has been performed using P-waves, S-waves and coda-waves and applying different, frequency dependent and independent, techniques. The methods used for this analysis have been: spectral and broadening-of-the-pulse, for direct P- and S-waves, coda normalization for S-waves, and single back-scatterin model for coda-waves. The results show that, in general, Q values are significantly smaller for the entire frequency range used (6-30 Hz) than those found in other volcanic and tectonic areas. The attenuation for P-waves is greater than for S-waves in the frequency independent methods, with a Q
                        $\beta$/Q
                        P ratio that ranges between 1.9 and 3.2. Comparing the Q-factor obtained for S-waves we have observed clear differences as a function of the method used; the coda normalization method has supplied significantly higher Q values (Q
                        d) than the other two methods (Q
                        $\beta$). We have interpreted this discrepancy as an effect of the methods: coda normalization and single back-scattering methods eliminate the contribution of the near-surface attenuation in their Q values. Comparing both Q
                        $\beta$ and Q
                        d we have estimated the near-surface attenuation under the recording site, named Q
                        $\kappa$. On the other hand, we have observed that Q
                        d has anomalous frequency dependence, with a minimum value at 21 Hz. This pattern is interpreted as an effect of strong scattering of the seismic waves in the source area of the earthquakes. Q
                        c values depend clearly with frequency and lapse time and the lapse time dependence could be interpreted as a depth dependence of the seismic attenuation in Deception Island volcano, Antarctica. The obtained Q values have allowed us to separate the contribution of intrinsic and scattering attenuation, deriving that the scattering attenuation is predominant over the intrinsic effects. Finally, in order to investigate how the heterogeneous medium of the volcanic island could produce other effects, we have checked whether it produces polarization of the shear-waves. The preliminary results of the polarization direction indicate a main E-W strain direction. All these evidences reveal the strongly heterogeneous structure of Deception Island volcano. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {Sediment cores from two glacier-fed lakes are used to reconstruct a continuous record of glacier variations since about 10,000 cal. BP in the Smorstabbtinden massif of central Jotunheimen, southern Norway. Particular attention is paid to the century- to millennial-scale, pre-Little Ice Age glacial signal based on an estimated temporal resolution of ??? 55 and ??? 25 yr cm-1 for Bovertunsvatnet and Dalsvatnet, respectively. Visible lithostratigraphic variations, organic content/loss-on-ignition, calcium carbonate content, magnetic susceptibility and grain-size fractions (especially the fine silt) are used as proxy indicators of glacier presence and extent in the lake catchments. Following deglaciation, the early Holocene was characterized by generally small glaciers until a major advance (the Finse Event) peaking at approximately 8200 cal. BP. From 7900 to at least 5300 cal. BP glaciers appear to have been absent from central Jotunheimen. There is evidence of glacier expansion between about 2400 and 1600 cal. BP (the Bovertun I Event) and between about 1400 and 800 cal. BP (the Bovertun II Event) before reduced glacier extent during the Mediaeval Warm Period. Finally, the most extensive Neoglacial maximum occurred during the Little Ice Age after 500 cal. BP. In addition to providing a record of the broad pattern of climatically forced Holocene glacier variations, periodicities at 110-140, 200-285 and about 500 yr have been identified. Uncertainties remain concerning the precise timing of events, glacierization and deglacierization detection thresholds, a possible mid- to late-Holocene (5300-2500 cal. BP) Neoglacial build-up of small glaciers, and shorter-term; decadal- to century-scale variations in glacier size, for which more proximal sites are required. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract     = {[1] We investigate the tectonics of the South Shetland Trench and Bransfield Strait by performing a detailed study of local seismicity. During 1997 - 1999 we deployed seven land seismometers and 14 ocean bottom seismometers in the South Shetland Island region. The data we obtained indicate a high level of local seismicity (m(b) 2 - 5), and we accurately located similar to 150 earthquakes. Many of the earthquakes occur at locations and depths indicative of ongoing subduction in the South Shetland trench. A focal mechanism for the largest event in the forearc indicates shallow angle thrusting. The maximum depth of seismicity is similar to 65 km, but the majority of the events are shallower than 30 km. These seismic results are consistent with recent magnetic, GPS, and multichannel seismic reflection data that suggest continued subduction at a very slow rate. The South Shetland trench thus represents an extreme end-member of hot subduction resulting from slow convergence of young lithosphere, and the absence of intermediate depth earthquakes is consistent with thermal assimilation of the slab at shallow depths. We have located many earthquakes associated with volcanism and rifting in Bransfield Strait. A swarm of events near a submarine volcano suggests current magmatic activity. A normal faulting focal mechanism in the northeastern part of the strait gives evidence of extension. Earthquakes associated with rifting in the northeastern portion of the strait are clustered along well-established rifts, but the seismicity is much more diffuse to the southwest. This observation is consistent with other evidence that extension has propagated from northeast to southwest.},

  abstract     = {The Glueckstadt Graben is one of the deepest post-Permian structures within the Central European Basin system and is located right at its "heart" at the transition from the North Sea to the Baltic Sea and from the Lower Saxony Basin to the Rynkoebing-Fyn High. The Mesozoic to recent evolution is investigated by use of selected seismic lines, seismic flattening and a 3D structural model. A major tectonic event in the latest Middle-Late Triassic (Keuper) was accompanied by strong salt tectonics within the Glueckstadt Graben. At that time, a rapid subsidence took place within the central part, which provides the "core" of the Glueckstadt Graben. The post-Triassic tectonic evolution of the area does not follow the typical scheme of thermal subsidence. In contrast, it seems that there is a slow progressive activation of salt movements triggered by the initial Triassic event. Starting with the Jurassic, the subsidence centre partitioned into two parts located adjacent to the Triassic "core." In comparison with other areas of the Central European Basin system, the Glueckstadt Graben was not strongly affected by additional Jurassic and Cretaceous events. During the late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, the area around the Glueckstadt Graben was affected by relative uplift with regional erosion of the elevated relief. However, subsidence was reactivated and accelerated during the Cenozoic when a strong subsidence centre developed in the North Sea. During Paleogene and Quaternary-Neogene, the two centres of sedimentation moved gradually towards the flanks of the basin. The data indeed point toward a control of post-Permian evolution by gradual withdrawal of salt triggered by the initial exhaustion along the Triassic subsidence centre. In this sense, the Glueckstadt Graben was formed at least partially as "basin scale rim syncline" during post-Permian times. The present day Hamburger, East and Westholstein Troughs are the actual final state of this long-term process which still may continue and may play a role in terms of young processes and, e.g., for coastal protection. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {Several selected seismic lines are used to show and compare the modes of Late-Cretaceous-Early Tertiary inversion within the North German and Polish basins. These seismic data illustrate an important difference in the allocation of major zones of basement (thick-skinned) deformation and maximum uplift within both basins. The most important inversion-related uplift of the Polish Basin was localised in its axial part, the Mid-Polish Trough, whereas the basement in the axial part of the North German Basin remained virtually flat. The latter was uplifted along the SW and to a smaller degree the NE margins of the North German Basin, presently defined by the Elbe Fault System and the Grimmen High, respectively. The different location of the basement inversion and uplift within the North German and Polish basins is interpreted to reflect the position of major zones of crustal weakness represented by the WNW-ESE trending Elbe Fault System and by the NW-SE striking Teisseyre-Tornquist Zone, the latter underlying the Mid-Polish Trough. Therefore, the inversion of the Polish and North German basins demonstrates the significance of an inherited basement structure regardless of its relationship to the position of the basin axis. The inversion of the Mid-Polish Trough was connected with the reactivation of normal basement fault zones responsible for its Permo-Mesozoic subsidence. These faults zones, inverted as reverse faults, facilitated the uplift of the Mid-Polish Trough in the order of 1-3 km. In contrast, inversion of the North German Basin rarely re-used structures active during its subsidence. Basement inversion and uplift, in the range of 3-4 km, was focused at the Elbe Fault System which has remained quiescent in the Triassic and Jurassic but reproduced the direction of an earlier Variscan structural grain. In contrast, N-S oriented Mesozoic grabens and troughs in the central part of the North German Basin avoided significant inversion as they were oriented parallel to the direction of the inferred Late Cretaceous-Early Tertiary compression. The comparison of the North German and Polish basins shows that inversion structures can follow an earlier subsidence pattern only under a favourable orientation of the stress field. A thick Zechstein salt layer in the central parts of the North German Basin and the Mid-Polish Trough caused mechanical decoupling between the sub-salt basement and the supra-salt sedimentary cover. Resultant thin-skinned inversion was manifested by the formation of various structures developed entirely in the supra-salt Mesozoic-Cenozoic succession. The Zechstein salt provided a mechanical buffer accommodating compressional stress and responding to the inversion through salt mobilisation and redistribution. Only in parts of the NGB and MPT characterised by either thin or missing Zechstein evaporites, thick-skinned inversion directly controlled inversion-related deformations of the sedimentary cover. Inversion of the Permo-Mesozoic fill within the Mid-Polish Trough was achieved by a regional elevation above uplifted basement blocks. Conversely, in the North German Basin, horizontal stress must have been transferred into the salt cover across the basin from its SW margin towards the basins centre. This must be the case since compressional deformations are concentrated mostly above the salt and no significant inversion-related basement faults are seismically detected apart from the basin margins. This strain decoupling in the interior of the North German Basin was enhanced by the presence of the Elbe Fault System which allowd strain localization in the basin floor due to its orientation perpendicular to the inferred Late Cretaceous-Early Tertiary far-field compression.},

  abstract     = {Compositional models of the Earth are critically dependent on three main sources of information: the seismic profile of the Earth and its interpretation, comparisons between primitive meteorites and the solar nebula composition, and chemical and petrological models of peridotite-basalt melting relationships. Whereas a family of compositional models for the Earth are permissible based on these methods, the model that is most consistent with the seismological and geodynamic structure of the Earth comprises an upper and lower mantle of similar composition, an FeNi core having between 5{\%} and 15{\%} of a low-atomic-weight element, and a mantle which, when compared to CI carbonaceous chondrites, is depleted in Mg and Si relative to the refractory lithophile elements. The absolute and relative abundances of the refractory elements in carbonaceous, ordinary, and enstatite chondritic meteorites are compared. The bulk composition of an average CI carbonaceous chondrite is defined from previous compilations and from the refractory element compositions of different groups of chondrites. The absolute uncertainties in their refractory element compositions are evaluated by comparing ratios of these elements. These data are then used to evaluate existing models of the composition of the Silicate Earth. The systematic behavior of major and trace elements during differentiation of the mantle is used to constrain the Silicate Earth composition. Seemingly fertile peridotites have experienced a previous melting event that must be accounted for when developing these models. The approach taken here avoids unnecessary assumptions inherent in several existing models, and results in an internally consistent Silicate Earth composition having chondritic proportions of the refractory lithophile elements at ??? 2.75 times that in CI carbonaceous chondrites. Element ratios in peridotites, komatiites, basalts and various crustal rocks are used to assess the abundances of both non-lithophile and non-refractory elements in the Silicate Earth. These data provide insights into the accretion processes of the Earth, the chemical evolution of the Earth's mantle, the effect of core formation, and indicate negligible exchange between the core and mantle throughout the geologic record (the last 3.5 Ga). The composition of the Earth's core is poorly constrained beyond its major constituents (i.e. an FeNi alloy). Density contrasts between the inner and outer core boundary are used to suggest the presence (??? 10 ?? 5{\%}) of a light element or a combination of elements (e.g., O, S, Si) in the outer core. The core is the dominant repository of siderophile elements in the Earth. The limits of our understanding of the core's composition (including the light-element component) depend on models of core formation and the class of chondritic meteorites we have chosen when constructing models of the bulk Earth's composition. The Earth has a bulk Fe Al of ??? 20 ?? 2, established by assuming that the Earth's budget of Al is stored entirely within the Silicate Earth and Fe is partitioned between the Silicate Earth (??? 14{\%}) and the core (??? 86{\%}). Chondritic meteorites display a range of Fe Al ratios, with many having a value close to 20. A comparison of the bulk composition of the Earth and chondritic meteorites reveals both similarities and differences, with the Earth being more strongly depleted in the more volatile elements. There is no group of meteorites that has a bulk composition matching that of the Earth's. ?? 1995.},

This build maintenance can become so burdensome that projects switch build technologies, potentially having to rewrite thousands of lines of build code. We aim to understand the prevalence of different build technologies and the relationship between build technology and build maintenance by analyzing version histories in a corpus of 177,039 repositories spread across four software forges, three software ecosystems, and four large-scale projects. We study low-level, abstraction-based, and framework-driven build technologies, as well as tools that automatically manage external dependencies. We find that modern, framework-driven build technologies need to be maintained more often and these build changes are more tightly coupled with the source code than low-level or abstraction-based ones. However, build technology migrations tend to coincide with a shift of build maintenance work to a build-focused team, deferring the cost of build maintenance to them.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies of the focal depths of earthquakes in old continental lithosphere have shown that they are almost entirely confined to the crust. Except where recent subduction of oceanic lithosphere is likely to have occurred, no earthquakes with a magnitude of {\textgreater} 5.5 have yet been located beneath the Moho. In contrast, in oceanic lithosphere earthquakes commonly occur within the mantle. The principal control on whether or not deformation occurs by brittle failure has long been believed to be temperature. We re-examine the thermal models of both oceans and shields. Taking account of the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity lowers the temperature within the oceanic lithosphere. Except beneath the outer rises of trenches, where the strain rates are large, intraplate oceanic earthquakes are confined to regions cooler than 600 ??C. In continental regions most earthquakes occur in the mobile belts that surround Archaean cratons, where the crust is as thick as 50-60 km. Recent studies, of the Canadian Shield in particular, have shown that radiogenic heating is not as concentrated at shallow depths as was previously believed. Taking account of both these effects and the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity increases the Moho temperatures, which can exceed 600 ??C, and produces geotherms that agree well with pressure and temperature estimates from nodule suites from kimberlites. Therefore the mechanical behaviour of oceanic and continental upper mantle appears to depend on temperature alone, and there is as yet no convincing evidence for any compositional effects. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {Available surface heat-flow measurements from Australian Proterozoic terranes (83+ or -18 mWm (super -2) ) are significantly higher than the global Proterozoic average of approximately 50 mWm (super -2) . Seismic evidence for the presence of relatively cool mantle together with the lack of evidence for neotectonic processes normally associated with thermal transients suggests that anomalous heat flow must reflect crustal radiogenic sources (U, Th and K). This is supported by a compilation of more than 6000 analyses from 455 individual granites, granitic gneisses and felsic volcanics which shows that the present-day average heat production of these rock types is 4.6 mu Wm (super -3) when normalised by area of outcrop (over more than 100 000 km (super 2) ); roughly twice that of "average" granite. At the time of this felsic magmatism (ca 1850-1500 Ma) heat production rates were some 25-30{\%} greater than the present day such that the total complement of U, Th and K in many parts of the Australian Proterozoic crust may have contributed as much as 60-85 mWm (super -2) to the surface heat flow, or 2 to 3 times the present-day continental average. This extraordinary enrichment has played a key role in the tectonothermal evolution of the Australian Proterozoic crust, and has important implications for our understanding of the thermal budget of ancient continental crust.},

Here the argument is made, using Pang??a as a model, that any supercontinent should include {\~{}}. 75{\%} of the preserved continental crust relevant to the time of maximum packing. As an example, Rodinia reached maximum packing at about 1.0. Ga and therefore should include 75{\%} of all continental crust older than 1.0. Ga. In attempting to 'name' any supercontinent, there is a clear precedent for models that provide a name along with a testable reconstruction within a reasonable temporal framework. Both Pang??a and Rodinia are near universally accepted names for the late Paleozoic and Neoproterozoic supercontinent respectively; however, there is a recent push to change the Paleo-Mesoproterozoic supercontinent moniker from ". Columbia" to ". Nuna". A careful examination of the ". Nuna" and ". Columbia" proposals reveals that although the term ". Nuna" was published prior to ". Columbia", the ". Nuna" proposal is a bit nebulous in terms of the constitution of the giant continent. Details of ". Nuna" given in the original manuscript appear to be principally based on previously published connections between Laurentia, Baltica and, to a lesser extent the Angara craton of Siberia (i.e. "the lands bordering the northern oceans"). Therefore the proposal is made that ". Columbia" consists of several core elements one of which is ". Nuna". ?? 2011 International Association for Gondwana Research.},

  abstract     = {During the Neoproterozoic, a supercontinent commonly referred to as Rodinia, supposedly formed at ca. 1100 Ma and broke apart at around 800-700 Ma. However, continental fits (e.g., Laurentia vs. Australia-Antarctica, Greater India vs. Australia-Antarctica, Amazonian craton [AC] vs. Laurentia, etc.) and the timing of break-up as postulated in a number of influential papers in the early-mid-1990s are at odds with palaeomagnetic data. The new data necessitate an entirely different fit of East Gondwana elements and western Gondwana and call into question the validity of SWEAT, AUSWUS models and other variants. At the same time, the geologic record indicates that Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic rift margins surrounded Laurentia, while similar-aged collisional belts dissected Gondwana. Collectively, these geologic observations indicate the breakup of one supercontinent followed rapidly by the assembly of another smaller supercontinent (Gondwana). At issue, and what we outline in this paper, is the difficulty in determining the exact geometry of the earlier supercontinent. We discuss the various models that have been proposed and highlight key areas of contention. These include the relationships between the various 'external' Rodinian cratons to Laurentia (e.g., Baltica, Siberia and Amazonia), the notion of true polar wander (TPW), the lack of reliable paleomagnetic data and the enigmatic interpretations of the geologic data. Thus, we acknowledge the existence of a Rodinia supercontinent, but we can place only loose constraints on its exact disposition at any point in time. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {Natural hazards like landslides, avalanches, floods and debris flows can result in enormous property damage and human casualties in mountainous regions. Switzerland has always been exposed to a wide variety of natural hazards mostly located in its alpine valleys. Recent natural disasters comprising avalanches, floods, debris flows and slope instabilities led to substantial loss of life and damage to property, infrastructure, cultural heritage and environment. In order to offer a solid technical infrastructure, a new concept and expert-tool based on an integrated web-based database/GIS structure is being developed under HazNETH. Given the HazNETH database design contemplates the detection and mapping of diagnostic features from remote sensors (e.g., ground, air and space borne) this paper analyses the use of remote sensing data in landslides studies during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, including a discussion of its potential and research challenges as result of new operational and forthcoming technologies such as the very high spatial resolution optical and infrared imagery of Ikonos, Quickbird, IRS CartoSat-1, ALOS, the satellite based interferometric SAR (InSAR and DInSAR of Radarsat, ERS, Envisat, TerraSAR-X, Cosmo/SkyMed, ALOS), micro-satellites like the Pl??iades, DMC, RapidEye, airborne LASER altimetry or ground-based differential interferometric SAR. The use of remote sensing data, whether air-, satellite- or ground-based varies according to three main stages of a landslide related study, namely a) detection and identification; b) monitoring; c) spatial analysis and hazard prediction. Accordingly, this paper presents and discusses previous applications of remote sensing tools as related to these three main phases, proposing a conceptual framework for the contribution of remote sensing to the design of databases for natural hazards like debris flows, and identifying areas for further research. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract     = {Cratons stabilized in the Archean because their mantle roots remained strong despite temperatures in the convecting mantle and amounts of radiogenic elements in the crust and in the lithospheric mantle that were larger than today. Thermal evolutionary models are developed using constraints from heat flow and heat production data in Archean provinces. The large time-scale of diffusive heat transport implies that the lithospheric mantle can remain thermally decoupled from the crust for as long as 1{~}Gyr. Heat production in the lithospheric mantle is a key variable in determining thermal conditions that permit stabilization of the crust and the preservation of a thick cratonic mantle root. Archean provinces are currently characterized by low heat flow, with an average of 41{~}mW m- 2 less than the global continental average (56{~}mW m- 2). The range of regionally averaged heat flow values in Archean provinces (18-54{~}mW m- 2) is narrower than in Proterozoic and Paleozoic terranes. However, at the end of the Archean, when crustal heat production was double the present value, surface heat flow would have varied over a range ($\approx$ 45-90{~}mW m- 2) at least as wide as that presently observed in Paleozoic provinces. The high crustal heat production during the Archean is not sufficient to account for elevated lower crustal temperatures recorded in some metamorphic assemblages without some additional heat input, or without the crust being thicker, or the vertical distribution of radioelements being different from today's. Thermal models and the observed correlation between the degree of upper crustal enrichment and heat production values indicate that crustal melting and differentiation were largely driven by heating due to in-situ radiogenic heat production. Even for values of the surface heat flow higher than average in cratons, the crust can be stabilized before 2.5{~}Ga if the radioelements are confined to shallow crustal layers. For present surface heat flow of 40-45{~}mW m- 2, calculations indicate that, prior to differentiation, the lowermost crust was near the solidus. Present heat production in the mantle root is constrained by estimates of the mantle heat flow. Further constraints can be obtained by modeling the past thermal regime of the root when heat production was higher. If heat generation is high and/or if the root is thick, the lower lithosphere must have cooled more rapidly than the convecting mantle, which implies that the temperature gradient was inverted at the base of the lithosphere and a weak mechanical layer formed in the middle of the root, precluding its survival. A low temperature gradient at the base of the root leads to the development of convective instabilities and possible removal of the lowermost part. Following its isolation from the convecting mantle and stabilization, thick continental lithosphere adjusts slowly to in-situ heat production and basal heat supply. We show that, due to in-situ heat production, temperatures in the lithospheric mantle may rise above their initial values inherited from the process of root formation due to in-situ radiogenic heat production. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {The sensitivity of oceanic gas hydrates and submarine slope stability to the combined forcing of sea level changes and bottom water perturbation is a critical issue for risk assessment in the Storegga Slide area on the mid-Norwegian margin. Evidence for the existence of gas hydrates both inside and outside the Storegga Slide complex comes from reflection seismic profiles, where a bottom-simulating reflection marks today's base of the gas hydrate stability zone. Paleo-bottom water temperatures show a relatively fast increase at approximately 12.5-10 ka (calendar years) following the Younger Dryas while stable warm water conditions have prevailed since then. Despite sea level rise, this warm-water inflow caused a major reduction in the thickness of the gas hydrate stability zone along the upper slope of the mid-Norwegian margin. Modelling results indicate that critical hydrate stability conditions and consequently the maximal potential pore pressure build-up occur at the location of the Storegga Slide headwall. Although the major phase of hydrate melting predates the Storegga slide event, dated at 8.2 ka (calendar years), reduced hydrate stability conditions could have facilitated or contributed to sub-marine slope failure. Additionally, the bottom-simulating reflections within the slide complex seem to have nearly adjusted to new equilibrium conditions, highlighting the dynamics of hydrate stability in continental margin sediments under environmental changes (climate change, geohazards). {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In situ 14C records the duration of exposure during the present interglaciation; any previously acquired 14C decayed below detection limits beneath thick LIS during the last glaciation. The in situ 14C exposure ages for two samples adjacent to a cold-based local ice cap are significantly less than for a nearby ice-free summit, suggesting that an expanded local ice cap shielded the ice-adjacent sites for at least 800 years, longer than the duration of the Little Ice Age. Disequilibrium between 10Be and 26Al concentrations in the same samples can be realistically explained by brief (ca. 10 kyr) intervals of exposure during peak interglacials (MIS 11, 9, 7, 5e, and 1), separated by long (ca. 50-100 kyr) intervals of complete shielding by the LIS. The lack of glacial erosion for at least the past 400 kyr suggests that the LIS was frozen to its bed across much of Baffin Island throughout the Middle and Late Quaternary. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract     = {Thirteen of 18 piston cores recovered from 'Robinson Lake' in the mid-Arctic vegetation zone of Baffin Island, Arctic Canada, penetrated stratified lacustrine sediment beneath a thin over-consolidated diamict (till) and postglacial lacustrine sediment. The sub-till lacustrine units are up to 120 cm thick, of which the upper several decimeters frequently contain thick, layered mats of aquatic moss; pollen and diatoms are common throughout both lacustrine units. A series of 23 AMS 14C dates defines the chronology of the postglacial sequence, which records a succession from a pioneer grass- and Oxyria-dominated tundra between 10.4 and 8 ka BP, to a sedge-dominated tundra after 8 ka BP. Limiting 14C dates place the sub-till lacustrine sediments more than 40 ka BP; 10 luminescence dates centered on 85 ka indicate they were deposited late in oxygen isotope stage (OIS) 5. The dominance of shrub and tree pollen, especially shrub birch and alder, in sub-till lacustrine samples, indicates low-arctic tundra farther north than at any time during the Holocene. Pollen concentrations are comparable to or higher than in the Holocene units. Cooling late in the interglacial is indicated by declining birch and alder pollen percentages in the upper part of the section. Diatom floras in both the sub-till and postglacial lacustrine sequences indicate similar development of lake-water chemistry, but input of silica and weathering products was greater in the older lake cycle, suggesting more vigorous catchment processes. Macrofossils in the sub-till units are characteristic of lakes ice-free in summer. Based on pollen assemblages indicating local and regional vegetation diagnostic of summer temperatures higher than the Holocene, we interpret the sub-till lacustrine units to be of interglacial character. By analogy with Holocene plant succession in central and eastern Canada, all of Keewatin and Labrador/Ungava must have been ice free throughout this interval, suggesting essentially complete deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet at the time.},

  abstract     = {Lake sediment cores and cosmogenic exposure (CE) dates constrain the pattern of deglaciation and evolution of climate across Baffin Island since the last glacial maximum (LGM). CE dating of erratics demonstrates that the northeastern coastal lowlands became ice-free ca.14 ka as the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) receded from its LGM margin on the continental shelf. Coastal lakes in southeastern Baffin Island started to accumulate sediment at this time, whereas initial lacustrine sedimentation was delayed by two millennia in the north. Reduced organic matter in lake sediment deposited during the Younger Dryas chron, and the lack of a glacial readvance at that time suggest cold summers and reduced snowfall. Ice retreated rapidly after 11 ka but was interrupted by a widespread readvance of both the LIS and local mountain glaciers ???9.6 ka (Cockburn Substage). A second readvance occurred just before 8 ka during a period of unusually cold summers, corresponding to the 8.2 ka cold event in the Greenland Ice Sheet. Most local glaciers were behind their present margins before 7 ka, and in some instances much earlier, although the Foxe Dome of the LIS continued to slowly retract toward the present day Barnes Ice Cap throughout the Holocene. Pollen in lake sediments is rare and dominated by exotic sources prior to 12 ka. Subsequently, grass tundra became established, followed by modern tundra vegetation ca. 8 ka, with subtle changes in pollen assemblages in the late Holocene. Lake primary productivity peaked in the early Holocene, before terrestrial vegetation or marine surface waters reached their apparent thermal maxima. Lacustrine, marine, and glacial proxies all reflect significant late Holocene cooling. The onset of Neoglaciation is well dated in lacustrine records at ca. 6 ka, with intensification after 2.5 ka. The expansion of local glaciers during the Little Ice Age represents the most extensive advance since 7 ka. We suggest that the replacement of Atlantic surface waters by cold, low-salinity Arctic Ocean water, coupled with the steady reduction of summer insolation, resulted in a significant positive sea-ice feedback that produced a larger late Holocene summer temperature depression over the Baffin region than in the Pacific sector of the Arctic. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract     = {Our conceptions of the NE sector of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) have evolved through three major paradigms over the past 50 years. Until the late 1960s the conventional view was that the Eastern Canadian Arctic preserved only a simple deglacial sequence from a LIS margin everywhere at the continental shelf edge (Flint Paradigm). Glacial geologic field studies began in earnest in this region in the early 1960s, and within the first decade field evidence documenting undisturbed deposits predating the LGM led a pendulum swing to a consensus view that large coastal stretches of the Eastern Canadian Arctic remained free of actively eroding glacial ice at the LGM, and that the most extensive ice margins occurred early in the last glacial cycle. This Minimalist Paradigm dominated until the late1980s when an expanded data set from shallow marine studies indicated LGM ice at least locally reached the continental shelf. Within the past decade the marine data, coupled with new evidence from lake sediments and cosmogenic exposure dates on moraines and glaciated terrain in the Eastern Canadian Arctic has led to a new paradigm that better reconciles the terrestrial and marine evidence. Collectively, these lines of evidence indicate that all of southern Baltin Island was glaciated at the LGM, but that some coastal uplands north of Cumberland Sound remained above the limit of actively eroding glacial ice, even though outlet glaciers reached the continental shelf in front of most fiords and sounds. The most plausible explanation for the observed glacial limits is that low-gradient, relatively fast-moving outlet glaciers sliding on deformable sediments occupied marine embayments and fiords, contrasting with slower moving ice frozen to its bed on the intervening crystalline terrain. Slow-moving ice frozen to its bed would have had steeper surface gradients, hence would have terminated inland from the coast. This scenario is consistent with observations indicating high-elevation coastal terrain remained unglaciated even though outlet glaciers reached the continental shelf. LGM summer temperatures were apparently much lower than present, as lakes in the ice-free regions were permanently frozen. ?? 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract     = {Well log data from three carbonate formations in Alberta were analyzed for relationships among Vp, Vs, proosity, density and lithology. A review of literature suggests that these relationships are highly variable among carbonates, and thus each geological setting should be characterized individually. In this well, Vp and Vs were inversely correlated with porosity i the Leduc formation. Velocity-porosity correlations were weak for the Pekisko and Wabamun carbonates. Vp/Vs did not appear to be correlated to porosity in any of the formations. Densities calculated from Gardner's relation were compared to measured well log densities. Calculated densities were close to measured densities in pure carbonates, but were underestimated in zones where anhydrite was present. Vs generally increased with density in pure carbonates, but sample with high anhydrite content had anomalously low velocities. Vp and Vs were linearly correlated in all the formations. The presence of anhydrite tended to raise the Vp/Vs ratio in the dolomites, and cause an overlap with the limestone Vp/Vs values. The Vp/Vs curve closely tracked the dolomite/anhydrite layers indicated by the photoelectron cross section index (PEF) log and the anhydrite fraction curve. The Vp/Vs Curve also tracked the PEF and the limestone fraction curve across the boundary between the dolomite/anhydrite facies and a limestone formation. In the carbonates studied here, Vp/Vs appears to be a good lithology indicator which is independent of porosity effects.},

  abstract     = {We predict sea-level change since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at four far-field sites (Barbados, Bonaparte Gulf, Huon Peninsula and Tahiti) using a revised theoretical formalism. This formalism includes a time-varying shoreline geometry, an accurate treatment of sea-level variations near regions of ice retreat and the influence of glacial cycle perturbations in Earth rotation. We elucidate the physics of far-field sea-level change by de-constructing the predicted signal into spatially uniform versus spatially varying components, as well as isolating contributions due to the ice load, the ocean load and the rotational potential. We demonstrate that the sum of these three contributions plus the spatially uniform sea-level fall associated the with retreat of grounded marine ice sheets can produce a significant difference between predictions of sea-level change at far-field sites and the eustatic (or meltwater) curve associated with the adopted ice model. This difference is site and time dependent. For example, the total sea-level rise since the LGM predicted using our ice-earth model can be either smaller (e.g., Barbados) or larger (e.g., Tahiti) than the eustatic sea-level change. Finally, we review procedures that have been applied to estimate continental ice volume from far-field sea-level observations and apply these procedures to data from Barbados and Bonaparte Gulf. Applying an ice-earth model that is tuned to fit the Barbados data, we estimate a change in grounded ice volume from the LGM to the present of 43.5-51 ?? 106km3 based on Barbados data and an LGM ice volume estimate of 51 ?? 106km3 based on Bonaparte Gulf data. Our results for the Bonaparte Gulf data are consistent with the recent study by Yokoyama et al. (Nature 406 (2000) 713). These LGM ice volume estimates map into a eustatic (or meltwater) sea-level rise of 115-135m. Taking into account plausible variations in the adopted radial earth model introduces uncertainties in the range of ?? 1.5 ?? 106km3 for ice volume estimates based on the Barbados data. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Here, by contrast, we develop an 'orthoversion' model whereby a succeeding supercontinent forms 90{$^{\circ}$} away, within the great circle of subduction encircling its relict predecessor. A supercontinent aggregates over a mantle downwelling but then influences global-scale mantle convection to create an upwelling under the landmass. We calculate the minimum moment of inertia about which oscillatory true polar wander occurs owing to the prolate shape of the non-hydrostatic Earth. By fitting great circles to each supercontinent's true polar wander legacy, we determine that the arc distances between successive supercontinent centres (the axes of the respective minimum moments of inertia) are 88{$^{\circ}$} for Nuna to Rodinia and 87{$^{\circ}$} for Rodinia to Pangaea--as predicted by the orthoversion model. Supercontinent centres can be located back into Precambrian time, providing fixed points for the calculation of absolute palaeolongitude over billion-year timescales. Palaeogeographic reconstructions additionally constrained in palaeolongitude will provide increasingly accurate estimates of ancient plate motions and palaeobiogeographic affinities.},

  abstract     = {The Central European Basin is a classic area of salt tectonics, characterized by heterogeneous structural evolution and complex salt movement history. We studied an area on its SW margin, based on prestack depth-migrated 2D and 3D seismic data. We use seismic interpretation and retro-deformation to obtain a better understanding of salt tectonics, structural control, and sedimentary response in this region. The first phase of salt tectonic evolution started with two main events of NW--SE extension and rafting in the Triassic before the Upper Bunter and before the Upper Muschelkalk. Rafting was accompanied by first salt diapirism and an increased sedimentary thickness adjacent to the salt structure. After salt supply ceased updip to the salt structure, a mini-basin grew in the intra-raft area. This sedimentary differential loading caused salt movement and growth of a pillow structure basinward. The second phase of salt movement was initiated by the formation of a NNW--SSE striking basement graben in the Middle Keuper that triggered reactive diapirism, the breakthrough of the pillow's roof and salt extrusion. The following downbuilding process was characterized by sedimentary wedges with basal unconformities, onlap structures and salt extrusions that ceased in the Jurassic. The third and latest phase of salt tectonic evolution was activated in the Late Cretaceous to Lower Tertiary by compressional tectonics indicated by salt rise and a small horizontal shortening of the diapir. The interpreted salt tectonic processes and the resulting geometries can now be better tied in with the regional heterogeneous framework of the basin.},

Chronologic control is provided by AMS 14C, electron-spin resonance, green-stimulated luminescence, and aspartic-acid geochronology. Major glaciations followed by deglaciation and marine inundation occurred during MIS 10-9, MIS 8-7, MIS 6-5e and MIS 5d-3. The MIS 6-5e event, associated with the high marine limit, implies ice-sheet thickness of {\textgreater}2000 m only 200 km from the deep Arctic Ocean, consistent with published evidence of ice grounding at ???1000 m water depth in the central Arctic Ocean. Till fabrics and glacial tectonics record repeated expansions of local ice caps exclusively, suggesting wet-based ice cap advance followed by cold-based regional ice-sheet expansion. Local ice caps over highland sites along the perimeter of the shallow Kara Sea, including the Byrranga Mountains, appear to have repeatedly fostered initiation of a large Kara Sea ice sheet, with exception of the Last Glacial Maximum (MIS 2), when Kara Sea ice did not impact Severnaya Zemlya and barely graced northernmost Taymyr Peninsula. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Little is known, however, about possible N2O variations during the more stable climate of the present interglacial (Holocene) spanning the last 11 thousand years. Here we fill this gap with a high-resolution N2O record measured along the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) Dome C Antarctic ice core. On the same ice we obtained high-resolution methane and carbon dioxide records. This provides the unique opportunity to compare variations of the three most important greenhouse gases (after water vapor) without any uncertainty in their relative timing. The CO2and CH4 records are in good agreement with previous measurements on other ice cores. The N2O concentration started to decrease in the early Holocene and reached minimum values around 8 ka ({\textless}260 ppbv) before a slow increase to its preindustrial concentration of {\~{}}265 ppbv.},

If station corrections for long-period P waves are computed using ray theory, as we do, unmodelled FF effects may be responsible for slow anomalies of up to 0.3 per cent beneath very small island stations, but these effects are negligible for larger islands such as Reunion and Kerguelen. The presence of a plume beneath these islands is the most probable explanation for the observed low velocities.$\backslash$n},

Here we present a Cenozoic palaeoceanographic record constructed from {\textgreater}400 m of sediment core from a recent drilling expedition to the Lomonosov ridge in the Arctic Ocean. Our record shows a palaeoenvironmental transition from a warm 'greenhouse' world, during the late Palaeocene and early Eocene epochs, to a colder 'icehouse' world influenced by sea ice and icebergs from the middle Eocene epoch to the present. For the most recent approximately 14 Myr, we find sedimentation rates of 1-2 cm per thousand years, in stark contrast to the substantially lower rates proposed in earlier studies; this record of the Neogene reveals cooling of the Arctic that was synchronous with the expansion of Greenland ice (approximately 3.2 Myr ago) and East Antarctic ice (approximately 14 Myr ago). We find evidence for the first occurrence of ice-rafted debris in the middle Eocene epoch (approximately 45 Myr ago), some 35 Myr earlier than previously thought; fresh surface waters were present at approximately 49 Myr ago, before the onset of ice-rafted debris. Also, the temperatures of surface waters during the Palaeocene/Eocene thermal maximum (approximately 55 Myr ago) appear to have been substantially warmer than previously estimated. The revised timing of the earliest Arctic cooling events coincides with those from Antarctica, supporting arguments for bipolar symmetry in climate change.},

The large-scale features of Antarctic upper mantle agree with global views of Earth structure under oceans and continents. Low seismic velocities map the hot thermal anomaly under mid-ocean ridges down to approximately 150 km, stronger and wider under faster-spreading ridges. Cold continental roots show as seismically fast material under the older part of the continent (East), while the West Antarctic Rift System has a clearly slow wave signature. The seismically imaged lithosphere has variable thickness under the craton. It appears rather regular and about 220 km thick under Dronning Maud Land, but it deepens in the region stretching below Enderby Land, Gamburtsev Mountains, to Wilkes Land, where it reaches its maximum thickness, in excess of 250 km. This variability in lithospheric thickness is analogous to what has been found under other continents. The high velocity anomaly imaging cratonic roots appears to spread out, as a cool halo, off the passive continental margins, but terminates sharply towards the West Antarctic Rift System. The fast/slow contact runs under the Transantarctic Mountains and it is particularly sharp in the Ross Embayment, where seismically slow material, imaged down to 250 km, can be interpreted as the deep-seated hot anomaly related to a mantle plume. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The onset and evolution of uplift in the central Basin and Range province and Colorado Plateau during this time is determined by tracking the topographic swell due to this mantle upwelling. We show that: (1) the extension and basaltic volcanism (post 25 Ma) in the central Basin and Range coincides with the arrival and eastward progression of this upwelling, and (2) dynamic uplift of the southern Colorado Plateau, totaling about 1 km, transpired in the last 20 Ma. Since 10 Ma, the center of uplift continued northeastward from the southwestern rim of the plateau consistent with a young Grand Canyon model and eastward sweep of magmatism in the western Colorado Plateau.},

Accurate knowledge of sound velocities in the lower-mantle minerals under relevant high-pressure, high-temperature conditions is essential in constraining the mineralogy and chemical composition using seismological observations, but previous acoustic measurements were limited to a range of low pressures and temperatures. Here we determine the shear-wave velocities for silicate perovskite and ferropericlase under the pressure and temperature conditions of the deep lower mantle using Brillouin scattering spectroscopy. The mineralogical model that provides the best fit to a global seismic velocity profile indicates that perovskite constitutes more than 93 per cent by volume of the lower mantle, which is a much higher proportion than that predicted by the conventional peridotitic mantle model. It suggests that the lower mantle is enriched in silicon relative to the upper mantle, which is consistent with the chondritic Earth model. Such chemical stratification implies layered-mantle convection with limited mass transport between the upper and the lower mantle.},

There is almost no age control on this chronology before 40 ka, except for some marine sediments correlated with marine isotope stage (MIS) 5e on the basis of their palaeofauna. Results from more southern latitudes have shown that dose estimates based on quartz OSL and the single aliquot regenerative (SAR) dose procedure may underestimate the age of MIS 5e deposits. Here we use the same method to date well-described marine sediments, thought to have been deposited during the very beginning of the Eemian interglacial at ???130 ka, and exposed in two sections on the river Sula in northern Russia. Various quality-control checks are used to show that the OSL behaviour is satisfactory; the mean of 16 ages is 112??2 ka (??=9 ka). This represents an underestimate of ???14{\%} compared to the expected age, a discrepancy similar to that reported elsewhere. In contrast to SAR, the single aliquot regeneration and added (SARA) dose procedure corrects for any change in sensitivity during the first OSL measurement. The SARA results are shown to be ???10{\%} older than those from SAR, confirming the geological age estimate and suggesting that SAR ages may underestimate older ages (larger doses), despite their good performance in the younger age range. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

By transferring the absolute dated tree ring chronology to the ice core time scale, we show that the coldest phase in the GRIP record occurred around 8150 yr BP. Furthermore, this method allows us to disentangle production and climate effects on 10Be and 14C with important implications for the reconstruction of past solar activity, and changes in the carbon cycle and 10Be transport. We show that, in principle, it is possible to infer changes in ocean circulation by comparing 10Be and 14C records. However, the duration of the 8200 yr BP event is too short to assign unambiguously a significant change in atmospheric 14C concentration to changes in the global ocean circulation. Based on the comparison of 10Be with climate records, one could argue that the 8200 yr BP cold event is triggered by a change towards lower solar activity. However, this link is questioned by the fact that around this period there are other similar and even stronger changes in solar activity that have no apparent connection to climate changes. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Prior to the period of direct solar observations, radionuclide abundances in natural archives provide the best-known proxies for changes in solar activity. Here we present two independent reconstructions of changes in solar activity during the last 1000 yr, which are inferred from 10Be and 14C records. We analyse the tree-ring 14C data (SHCal, IntCal04 from 1000 to 1510 AD and annual data from 1511 to 1950 AD) and four 10Be records from Greenland ice cores (Camp Century, GRIP, Milcent and Dye3) together with two 10Be records from Antarctic ice cores (Dome Concordia and South Pole). In general, the 10Be and 14C records exhibit good agreement that allows us to obtain reliable estimates of past solar magnetic modulation of the radionuclide production rates. Differences between 10Be records from Antarctica and Greenland indicate that climatic changes have influenced the deposition of 10Be during some periods of the last 1000 yr. The radionuclide-based reconstructions of past changes in solar activity do not always agree with the sunspot record, which indicates that the coupling between those proxies is not as close as has been sometimes assumed. The tree-ring 14C record and 10Be from Antarctica indicate that recent solar activity is high but not exceptional with respect to the last 1000 yr. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We have revised the early reconstructions using a newly proposed breakup chronology of Australia and Antarctica which suggests that opening began at least 90 m.y. B.P. at an initially slow rate. This eliminates the overlap problem without invoking major age differences within the Kerguelen Plateau. We also suggest that the northeastern flank of Kerguelen Plateau may be underlain by the "missing" westward continuation of the Diamantina Zone.

The high-resolution data set and improved methodology reveal not only several velocity features that are consistent with previous studies but also important new details that clarify the velocity structures associated with volcanic processes beneath Mount Fuji and the collision tectonics of the South Fossa Magna. One such particular feature is a low-VP, low-VS and low-VP/VS anomaly at depths of 7--17 km beneath Mount Fuji that corresponds with the locations of deep low-frequency (DLF) earthquakes. The coincidence of the velocity anomaly and the DLF locations suggests that supercritical volatile fluid, such as H2O and CO2, may be abundant in the low-VP/VS region and may play an important role in generating DLF earthquakes. This anomaly overlies a deeper low-VP, low-VS and high-VP/VS anomaly at depths of 15--25 km that may represent a zone of basaltic partial melt. A low-VP, low-VS and low-VP/VS anomaly is seen at depths of 6--14 km beneath Mount Hakone. Isovelocity surfaces (VP = 6.0 km/s and VS = 3.5 km/s) corresponding to the upper limit of hypocenter distribution below Mount Fuji may define the upper surface of the Philippine Sea plate whose existence in a seismic gap beneath Mount Fuji has been controversial.

  abstract     = {A computer ice sheet model has been used to study regional ice flow directions and glacial erosion of the Weichselian ice sheet, adopting a new method of presenting modelled ice flow directions. Ice sheet model results from different time periods during the Weichselian were extracted for five regions and presented in rose diagrams. When comparing these computer-generated results with information on flow directions obtained from current conceptual geological models based on field data, large similarities were observed. In comparing the ice flow directions as such, the similarities were strikingly good. In many cases there was also a good agreement in the timing of the events, while in some cases a certain flow direction was assigned to a different time period by the ice sheet model than in the current interpretation of geological information. Nevertheless, the overall agreement between the data sets shows that results from ice sheet models can aid in placing geological information into a coarse timeframe and chronostratigraphic context, and also fill in time gaps in the glacial geological record where chronological control is sparse. Ice sheet model results thus constitute a new data set against which glacial geological information can be compared and tested. A new quantity, basal sliding distance, has also been calculated from the ice sheet model results, describing the over time accumulated length of ice that has passed over the landscape by basal sliding. The results show high basal sliding distance values in SW Sweden/SE Norway, in Skagerrak, and along the Gulf of Bothnia, implying relatively large amounts of glacial erosion in these regions. On elevated parts of the Scandinavian mountain range and on adjacent plains in the east the basal sliding distance values are low, implying weaker glacial erosion. This compares well with different types of geological and morphological data, suggesting that basal sliding distance is a useful entity for studying regional patterns of glacial erosion intensity. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Increased freshwater inflow to the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans has been suggested as one of the most likely mechanisms to explain the abrupt and significant Lateglacial and early Holocene climatic events in NW Europe. The largest early Holocene glacier readvances occurred $\sim$11,200, 10,500, 10,100, 9700, 9200 and 8400-8000 cal. yr BP. The studied Norwegian glaciers apparently melted away at least once during the early/mid-Holocene. The period with the most contracted glaciers in Scandinavia was between 6600 and 6000 cal. yr BP. Subsequent to $\sim$6000 cal. yr BP the glaciers started to advance and the most extensive glaciers existed at about $\sim$5600, 4400, 3300, 2300, 1600 cal. yr BP, and during the 'Little Ice Age'. Times with overall less glacier activity were apparently around 5000, 4000, 3000, 2000, and 1200 cal. yr BP. It has been proposed that several glacier advances occurred in Scandinavia (including northern Sweden) at $\sim$8500-7900, 7400-7200, 6300-6100, 5900-5800, 5600-5300, 5100-4800, 4600-4200, 3400-3200, 3000-2800, 2700-2000, 1900-1600, 1200-1000, and 700-200 cal. yr BP. Glaciers in northern Sweden probably reached their greatest 'Little Ice Age' extent between the 17\textsuperscript{th} and the beginning of the 18\textsuperscript{th} centuries. Evidence for early Holocene glacier advances in northern Scandinavia, however, has been questioned by more recent, multi-disciplinary studies. The early to mid-Holocene glacier episodes in northern Sweden may therefore be questioned. Most Norwegian glaciers attained their maximum 'Little Ice Age' extent during the mid-18\textsuperscript{th} century. Cumulative glacier length variations in southern Norway, based on marginal moraines dated by lichenometry and historic evidence, show an overall retreat from the mid-18\textsuperscript{th} century until the 1930s-40s. Subsequently, most Norwegian glaciers retreated significantly. Maritime outlet glaciers with short frontal time lags ({\textless}10-15 years) started to advance in the mid-1950s, whereas long outlet glaciers with longer frontal time lags ({\textgreater}15-20 years) continued their retreat to the 1970s and 1980s. However, maritime glaciers started to advance as a response to higher winter accumulation during the first part of the 1990s. After 2000 several of the observed glaciers have retreated remarkably fast (annual frontal retreat {\textgreater} 100 m) mainly due to high summer temperatures. The general glacier retreat during the early Holocene and the Neoglacial advances after 6000 cal. yr BP are in line with orbital forcing, due to the decrease of Northern Hemisphere summer solar insolation and the increase in winter insolation. In addition, regional weather modes, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Arctic Oscillation (AO), play a significant role with respect to decadal and multi-decadal climate variability. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract     = {Documentation of glacier changes is a key element for reconstruction of past climate variability and early detection of global climate change. In this paper, records of Holocene glacier variations in different regions in Norway have been synthesised. During the period from approximately 8000 to 4000{~}cal. yr BP, most glaciers in Norway were completely melted away at least once due to high summer temperatures and/or reduced winter precipitation. Lichenometrically and historically dated moraines at Jostedalsbreen, in Jotunheimen, at Hardangerj{\o}kulen, and at Folgefonna were used to extend records of glacier length variations back to their maximum position during the 'Little Ice Age'. The timing of the maximum 'Little Ice Age' glacial advance in different parts of southern Norway varied considerably, ranging from the early 18\textsuperscript{th} century to the late 19\textsuperscript{th} century. Cumulative glacier length variations of glaciers in southern Norway show an overall retreat from $\sim$ AD 1750 to the 1930s-40s. Thereafter, most Norwegian glaciers retreated significantly. Short maritime outlet glaciers with a short response time ({\textless} 10-15{~}yr) started to advance in the mid-1950s, whereas long outlet glaciers with longer frontal time lag ({\textgreater} 15-20{~}yr) continued their retreat to the 1980s. In the 1990s, however, several of the maritime glaciers started to advance as a response to higher winter accumulation during the first part of the 1990s. Since 2000 most of the observed glaciers have retreated remarkably fast (annual frontal retreat {\textgreater} 100{~}m) mainly due to high summer temperatures. The last glacier inventory in Norway published in 1988 shows that there were 1627 glaciers covering a total area of 2609{~}km2 with an estimated volume of 164{~}km3. Modern climate-glacier relationships from mass balance data in Scandinavia have been used to present possible effects on the Norwegian glaciers of climate scenarios between 1961-1990 and 2070-2100 presented by the 'RegClim' project. This long-term weather 'forecast' for western Norway indicates a rise in the summer temperature of 2.3{~}{$^{\circ}$}C and an increase in the winter precipitation of 16{\%} by the end of the 21\textsuperscript{st} century. This climate scenario may, if it occurs, cause the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) to rise 260 $\pm$ 50{~}m. As a result, about 98{\%} of the Norwegian glaciers are likely to disappear and the glacier area may be reduced $\sim$ 34{\%} by AD 2100. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The cosmogenic exposure dates suggest that the lower blockfield boundary/ trimline along the Andoya-Skanland transect represents the upper limit of the Late Weichselian ice sheet, with an average surface gradient of c. 9.5 m/km. The surface exposure dates from Andoya pre-date the LGM, suggesting that the LGM ice sheet did not reach mountain plateaux at northwest Andoya. The results thus support evidence from lake sediment records that the northern tip of Andoya was not covered by the Scandinavian Ice Sheet during the LGM.},

  abstract     = {The valleys surrounding the Jostedalsbreen ice cap were deglaciated during the latter half of the Preboreal Chronozone. At the end of the Preboreal Chronozone, however, a glacier readvance occurred. Terminal moraines were deposited by outlet valley glaciers from the Jostedalsbreen Plateau up to 1 km beyond Little Ice Age moraines. Inferred from the altitude of lateral moraines formed during this readvance and calculations of the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) depression based on an accumulation area ratio (AAR) of 0.6, the average depression of the ELA was 325 + 75 -115 m below the present. By assuming a similar precipitation pattern as at present, this suggests a mean temperature decline of about 2??C. Palynological investigations from Sygneskardet, Sunndalen, indicate that climate like the present was achieved just after 9000 BP. The Holocene climatic optimum occurred during the Atlantic Chronozone, with elm (Ulmus) stands growing at the present birch (Betula) forest limit in Sunndalen and pine (Pinus) growing at Styggevatnet to an altitude of at least 1160 m. During this period the mean summer temperature is estimated to have been at least 2.7 and 1.8??C warmer than at present, with and without the local climatic effect of Jostedalsbreen, respectively. An inferred rise of the ELA of about 400 m from the present altitude suggests that possibly no glaciers existed on the Jostedalsbreen Plateau during the Holocene climatic optimum. Vegetational changes as deduced from palynological studies, lowered tree limits and increased resedimentation in peat bogs indicate general climatic deterioration since the Late Atlantic Chronozone. A significant Alnus decline 6300 BP and a Betula expansion 5300 BP, as recorded from palynological studies of peat bogs in Sprongdalen, is interpreted to represent the initial Neoglaciation on the Jostedalsbreen Plateau. Lithostratigraphic evidence at a section in the upper part of Glomsdalen may indicate a minor Neoglacial phase close to 6000 BP. The first pronounced Neoglacial event in the Jostedalsbreen region, however, was bracketed between 3700 and 3100 BP. Sp??rteggbreen, the upper part lying ca. 30 m above the present regional glaciation threshold, was formed around 500 BP at the initiation of the Little Ice Age. Gelifluction at 1000 m altitude began after 3200-2800 BP. During the Medieval Period, glaciers were smaller than now. At the northwestern part of Jostedalsbreen an initial Little Ice Age glacier expansion is dated to have occurred after 890 ?? 60 BP (A.D. 1030-1220). From the early 14\textsuperscript{th} century, and especially from the mid-17\textsuperscript{th} century, a severe climatic deterioration during the Little Ice Age is historically documented. Around Jostedalsbreen this advance culminated during the mid-18\textsuperscript{th} century. Documents suggest that the western outlet glaciers from Jostedalsbreen reached their maximum Little Ice Age position some years before the longer eastern outlet valley glaciers. A typical depression of the ELA during the Little Ice Age of 100-150 m indicates a mean temperature decline from the present of ca. 0.5-1??C. ?? 1991.},

These dynamic changes seem to be parallel to the warming trend in Greenland, but the mechanisms that link climate and ice dynamics are poorly understood, and current numerical models of ice sheets do not simulate these changes realistically6, 7, 8. Uncertainties in the predictions of mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet have therefore been highlighted as one of the main limitations in forecasting future sea levels9. Here we present a numerical ice-flow model that reproduces the observed marked changes in Helheim Glacier, one of Greenland's largest outlet glaciers. Our simulation shows that the ice acceleration, thinning and retreat begin at the calving terminus and then propagate upstream through dynamic coupling along the glacier. We find that these changes are unlikely to be caused by basal lubrication through surface melt propagating to the glacier bed. We conclude that tidewater outlet glaciers adjust extremely rapidly to changing boundary conditions at the calving terminus. Our results imply that the recent rates of mass loss in Greenland's outlet glaciers are transient and should not be extrapolated into the future.},

The Carlsberg Fault is located in a NNW-SSE striking fault system in the border zone between the Danish Basin and the Baltic Shield. Recent earthquakes indicate that this area is tectonically active. A seismic refraction study across the Carlsberg Fault shows that the fault zone is a low-velocity zone and marks a change in seismic velocity structure. A normal incidence reflection seismic section shows a coincident flower-like structure. We have recorded seismic signals in a fan geometry from shots detonated both inside the low-velocity fault zone and up to {\~{}}500 m away from the fault zone. The seismic energy was recorded on three receiver arrays (1.5- to 2.4-km-long arcs) across the expected location of the {\~{}}400- to 700-m-wide fault zone at distances of up to {\~{}}7 km from the shots. Shots detonated inside the fault zone result in (1) weak and delayed first arrivals on the receivers located inside the fault zone compared to earlier and stronger first arrivals outside the fault zone; (2) strong guided P and S waves as well as surface waves inside the fault zone. The fault zone is a shadow zone to shots detonated outside the fault zone. Finite-difference wavefield modelling supports the interpretations of the fan recordings. Our fan recording approach facilitates cost-efficient mapping of fault zones in densely urbanized areas where seismic normal incidence and refraction profiling are not feasible.},

An iceberg turbate north of the Faroe Islands provides evidence of large-scale drift of ultra-deep draft ({\textgreater}600 m) icebergs in the Nordic Seas at pre-Weichselian glacial stage(s). Marginal and transverse troughs found on the eastern and western shelf are suggested to have formed during the same glacial period(s) as the iceberg turbate. Iceberg plough-marks and abundant ice rafted material of non-Faroese origin, together with the relict moraine ridges encircling the Faroe Islands at around the 100 and 200 m water depth contours, indicate that the outer shelf was probably ice free during the Weichselian ice age. On the slopes and basinal parts, the formation of fine-grained contourites was favoured during (Weichselian) glacial stages when bottom currents were reduced. Sediment overloading during these glacial stages resulted in repeated slope instability, causing mass failures of the contourite deposits. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Most sedimentary rocks are found to be characterized by a set of fractal conducting paths whose number density is essentially determined by a cross section through the fractal pore space. Some exceptions to the typical behaviour are discussed. The model is also extended to the derivation of permeability expressions for which it is shown that a general form cannot be obtained because the pore and conductivity subspaces do not have a general relationship to that of the permeability.},

  abstract     = {The presence of water strongly influences the structure, composition and dynamics of the Earth's deep mantle. Hydrous magnesium-rich silicates play an important role in transporting water into the deep mantle when oceanic plates subduct as slabs. The highest-pressure form of such hydrous silicates, phase D, was reported to dissociate into an assemblage of nominally anhydrous phases plus water at pressures of about 44 GPa, equivalent to 1,250 km depth. In this way, free water would be released in the middle region of the lower mantle, which suggests that no water can reach the deeper regions of the lower mantle. Here we use in situ X-ray measurements in conjunction with a multi-anvil apparatus using sintered diamond anvils to show that hydrous phases are stable under lower mantle conditions up to 50 GPa. We found that phase D transforms to an assemblage with another hydrous silicate (MgSiH2O4), named phase H, at pressures above about 48 GPa. Our results suggest that phase H is the dominant hydrous silicate in descending slabs, and may be found at depths far deeper than 1,250 km. We conclude that a significant amount of water is retained in the descending slabs and may be delivered to the deepest part of the lower mantle.},

  abstract     = {We review the resolution currently available with seismic tomography, in particular the ability of seismic waves to image mantle plumes, and discuss frequently asked questions about artifacts, interpretation and possible systematic errors. These aspects are discussed in more detail for two case histories offering different problems in the tomographic interpretation: Iceland and Hawaii. Regional and global models resolve a vertical low velocity anomaly beneath Iceland, interpreted as an upwelling, from the transition zone up to the base of the lithosphere. Beneath the transition zone any continuation of the low-velocity anomaly is weak at best. This may be due to the absence of such an anomaly, poor seismic resolution in the lower mantle, or the weak sensitivity of velocity to buoyancy at these depths. While we are confident of the presence of a plume in the upper mantle, its origins remain to be resolved. Because of its large distance to most seismic sources and stations, the mantle structure under Hawaii is among the most difficult to image tomographically, but several recent global tomography studies agree on a whole-mantle plume under the Hawaiian hotspot. The plume exhibits a tilting geometry, which is likely due to the mantle flow. Theoretical advances, as well as deployments of large seismic networks across hotspot regions, are expected to bring significant improvements to the imaging of narrow mantle upwellings in the near future. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Increasingly, however, evidence suggests that ordering of material over seismic wavelengths occurs there, but it is unclear what causes this. We use the method of source-side shear wave splitting to examine the anisotropy surrounding earthquakes deeper than 200 km in slabs around the globe. We find significant amounts of splitting ($\leq$2.4 s), confirming that the transition zone is anisotropic here. However, there is no decrease in the amount of splitting with depth, as would be the case for a metastable tongue of olivine which thins with depth, suggesting this is not the cause. The amount of splitting does not appear to be consistent with processes in the ambient mantle, such as lattice-preferred orientation development in wadsleyite, ringwoodite, or MgSiO3-perovskite. We invert for the orientation of several mechanisms---subject to uncertainties in mineralogy and deformation---and the best fit is given by updip flattening in a style of anisotropy common to hydrous phases and layered inclusions. We suggest that highly anisotropic hydrous phases or hydrated layering is a likely cause of anisotropy within the slab, implying significant water transport from the surface down to at least 660 km depth.},

We make use of a heterogeneous, generally anisotropic model of elasticity in D" derived from a 3-D model of mantle flow, which is obtained by inversion of geophysical observables. Unlike previous approaches, completely general, 3-D flow and full anisotropy are permitted, yielding more information to compare with observations than has been possible before. We model observations of anisotropy in D" by calculating the shear wave splitting predicted in ScS waves for a series of models of ppv plasticity. We find that observations in regions of the lowermost mantle beneath subduction zones are best fit by a modelwhich accommodates slip on (010).

In recent years dense seismic networks have revealed a wealth of information about the seismic properties of this region, which are distinct from those of the mantle above. Here we review observations of seismic anisotropy in this region. In the past it has been assumed that the region exhibits a simple form of transverse isotropy with a vertical symmetry axis (VTI anisotropy). We summarise new methodologies for characterising a more general style of anisotropy using observations from a range of azimuths. The observations can be then used to constrain the mineralogy of the region and its style of deformation by a lattice preferred orientation (LPO) of the constituent minerals. Of specific interest is the recent discovery of the stability of the post-perovskite phase in this region, which might explain many enigmatic properties of D$\prime$$\prime$. Mantle flow models based on density models derived from global tomographic seismic velocity models can be used to test plausible mineralogies, such as post-perovskite, and their deformation mechanisms. Here we show how linked predictions from mineral physics, geodynamical modelling and seismic observations can be used to better constrain the dynamics, mineralogy and physical properties of the lowermost mantle. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

It corresponds to the recent developments in both e-Science and computational technologies which call for a novel publishing paradigm. As part of this paradigm, static content (such as traditional scientific publications) should be supplemented with elements of interactivity, enabling reviewers and readers to reexamine the reported results by executing parts of the software on which such results are based as well as access primary scientific data. Taking into account the presented rationale we propose an environment which enables authors to seamlessly embed chunks of executable code (called assets) into scientific publications and allow repeated execution of such assets on underlying computing and data storage resources, as required by scientists who wish to build upon the presented results. The Collage Authoring Environment can be deployed on arbitrary resources, including those belonging to high performance computing centers, scientific e-Infrastructures and resources contributed by the scientists themselves. The environment provides access to static content, primary datasets (where exposed by authors) and executable assets. Execution features are provided by a dedicated engine (called the Collage Server) and embedded into an interactive view delivered to readers, resembling a traditional research publication but interactive and collaborative in its scope. Along with a textual description of the Collage environment the authors also present a prototype implementation, which supports the features described in this paper. The functionality of this prototype is discussed along with theoretical assumptions underpinning the proposed system. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Sediment composition and stable isotope data suggest three distinct paleoenvironments: (1) a productive region in the eastern to central Fram Strait and along the northern Barents Sea continental margin characterized by Atlantic Water advection, frequent open water conditions, and occasional local meltwater supply and iceberg calving from the Barents Sea Ice Sheet; (2) an intermediate region in the southwestern Eurasian Basin (up to 84-85degreesN) and the western Fram Strait characterized by subsurface Atlantic Water advection and recirculation, a moderately high planktic productivity, and a perennial ice cover that breaks up only occasionally; and (3) a central Arctic region (north of 85degreesN in the Eurasian Basin) characterized by a low-salinity surface water layer and a thick ice cover that strongly reduces bioproduction and bulk sedimentation rates. Although the total inflow of Atlantic Water into the Arctic Ocean may have been reduced during the LGM, its impact on ice coverage and halocline structure in the Fram Strait and southwestern Eurasian Basin was strong.},

  abstract     = {[1] Marine geophysical data from the Antarctic continental shelf indicate the former presence of ice streams that drained through bathymetric troughs during the last glacial cycle. Streaming flow is recorded by elongate subglacial bedforms, formed in the upper part of an acoustically transparent sediment layer. Cores from the layer demonstrate that it is a weak and porous subglacial till ("soft till''). Shear within the soft till was concentrated in zones that were 0.1-0.9 m thick. The soft till is a "hybrid'' till, formed by a combination of subglacial sediment deformation and lodgment. The base of the soft till is marked by a strong reflector which represents the top of a denser and stronger "stiff till.'' The form of this reflector ranges from flat and continuous to deeply grooved and irregular, implying the operation of different mechanisms of sediment mobilization and incorporation into the soft till layer. The irregular form of the basal reflector is consistent with grooving, whereas the flat and continuous form is more consistent with sediment mobilization as a subglacial traction carpet related to changes in basal effective stress. Geophysical evidence for large-scale advection of the soft till, combined with evidence for deformation partitioning into relatively thin layers up to 0.9 m thick, indicates that localized shear zones integrated to transport significant volumes of sediment beneath Antarctic paleo-ice streams.},

  abstract     = {The classical model of trough mouth fan (TMF) formation was developed in the Polar North Atlantic to explain large submarine fans situated in front of bathymetric troughs that extend across continental shelves to the shelf break. This model emphasizes the delivery of large volumes of subglacial sediment to the termini of ice streams flowing along troughs, and subsequent re-deposition of this glacigenic sediment down the continental slope via debris-flow processes. However, there is considerable variation in terms of the morphology and large-scale sediment architecture of continental slopes in front of palaeo-ice streams. This variability reflects differences in slope gradient, the relative contributions of meltwater sedimentation compared with debris-flow deposition, and sediment supply/geology of the adjacent continental shelf. TMF development is favoured under conditions of a low ({\textless}1{\&}DEG;) slope gradient; a passive-margin tectonic setting; abundant, readily erodible sediments on the continental shelf - and thus associated high rates of sediment delivery to the shelf edge; and a wide continental shelf. The absence of large sediment fans on continental slopes in front of cross-shelf troughs should not, however, be taken to indicate the former absence of palaeo-ice streams in the geological record.},

Bedforms exhibit progressive elongation with distance along the trough, and record flow of a paleo-ice stream from the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet during the last glacial maximum. Downflow evolution of the bedforms indicates increasing flow velocities as the ice stream traversed the shelf. This, in turn, is related to a transition from crystalline bedrock on the inner shelf to a soft sedimentary substrate on the outer shelf. Although streaming flow operated across both substrates, the highest flow velocities occurred over the soft bed. Spatial variation in the inferred nature of fast-flow, from sliding to subglacial sediment deformation and/or ploughing, was also lithologically controlled.

Superimposed on the East Antarctic plateau are the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains, the Dronning Maud Land Mountains and the Vostok Highlands with modal elevations {\~{}}400 m in excess of the East Antarctic mode. To ascertain whether East Antarctica's anomalous topography can be attributed to Airy-type crustal compensation, a continental-scale crustal thickness model was derived from the inversion of GOCO03S satellite gravity data constrained by seismic crustal thickness estimates. The average crustal thickness of East Antarctica is {\~{}}40 km (for West Antarctica {\~{}}24 km), a value typical of continental shields, and while crustal thicknesses of {\textgreater}50 km locally beneath the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains and Dronning Maud Land can account for their differential modal elevation above the plateau, crustal thicknesses elsewhere across East Antarctica offer no suggestion of crustal-level continental-scale support for the broader plateau. Enderby Land, for example, resides on the plateau and is characterised by a modal elevation of {\~{}}750 m and crust {\~{}}40 km thick, whereas off the plateau in East Antarctica, the Aurora and Wilkes Subglacial Basins have modal elevations of {\~{}}. - 50m and {\~{}}50 m, respectively, yet similarly thick crust. The lack of crustal support for the elevated broader East Antarctic plateau, coupled with seismic images showing fast upper mantle velocities beneath the plateau, suggest a mid-to-lower mantle source for East Antarctica's anomalous topography. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract     = {The Norwegian Barents Sea with multiple source rock inter- vals represents a prime example of an overfilled petroleum system. However, several episodes of uplift and erosion from the Paleocene until the Pliocene-Pleistocene have caused the depletion of hydrocarbon accumulations in the region. These uplift events were not only potentially catastrophic but have also caused the redistribution of the remaining oil and gas over laterally large distances in the Barents Sea region. This redistribution directed petroleum to distal parts of the vari- ous hydrocarbon-generating basins, thus charging traps, which otherwisewould not have been reached. Therefore,we expect that discoveries will be made in distal basin settings, particu- larly in trapswith partly leaking cap rocks,which can bleed off gas and thereby retain oil. Many oil accumulations in the re- gion represent various mixtures of oils from several different stratigraphic source intervals. This suggests that Triassic and Paleozoic oils may be trapped below the presently drilled tar- gets, which are mostly Jurassic in the Hammerfest Basin and older to the north and east. Deeper exploration targets also stand a higher chance of containing oil because the amount of gasbeing releasedfromoilduring uplift, erosion,andsubsequent pressure release is lower. Uplift and erosion are followed by a reduction in temperature. This iswhyhydrocarbon generation is believed to have ended in uplifted areas. Some discoveries in this data set suggest, however, a significant fresh gas charge.},

C-type olivine fabric (developed by the (1. 0. 0) [0. 0. 1] slip system) and similar fabrics were dominantly developed in a wide range of water content (COH=49-19,242. ppm H/Si in olivine). Because the seismic fast a-axes are perpendicular to the shear plane only for C-type fabric, a positive-negative transition of VSH VSV (difference in velocity between horizontally and vertically polarized shear waves) inevitably occurs when C-type fabric is developed by a pressure-induced fabric transition. The positive-negative transition of VSH VSV at {\~{}}200. km depth reported in global one-dimensional models is known to be well explained by the horizontal flow of olivine with a low water content ({\textless}750. ppm H/Si in olivine). Our results demonstrate that the presence of a moderate or high water content in olivine (???750. ppm H/Si) results in a drastic increase of the boundary depth for the VSH VSV positive-negative transition (300-370. km depth), namely, "wet" olivine flows cannot account for global one-dimensional models, suggesting that the whole upper mantle is mostly occupied by low-water content regions and the distribution of moderate- or high-water content regions is limited to a small part of the upper mantle. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

A complex system of canyons, channels and slope failure features on the steep margins of the trough is resolved on the TRIM (TOBI Rockall Irish Margins Project) deep-towed sidescan survey. The canyons consist of a complex headwall gullied region, produced by multiple slope failure events, and interconnect to form a cauliform pattern in plan view. Individual gullies are U-shaped in cross-section in the upper parts of the margin and are connected downslope to single, deeply-incised, V-shaped channels. These channels feed extensive aprons of sediment on the lower slope supplied by failure of the headwall regions and sediment transport along the shelf into the canyon headwalls. The change in the canyon morphology systems reflects a more abundant supply of glaciomarine sedimentary debris from Pleistocene ice sheets, whose southerly limit lay along this part of the eastern Rockall margin. A good correlation between acoustic sidescan backscatter and more deeply penetrating 3.5??kHz profiler data suggests that sediment transport pathways were stable through time. Slope failure escarpments occur in association with the canyon systems along the upper part of the slope. Canyons are absent in the north of the area where the slope gradient is lowest. This is interpreted as the result of progradation of sheet-like flows of glaciomarine debris across the southern part of the Donegal Fan. A poor correlation between acoustic backscatter and sub-bottom profile data indicates that sediment transport pathways varied through time in the region. Evidence for strong northeast-flowing bottom currents is present along the upper slope and shelf. These currents transport and sort sediments along the entire eastern margin of the Rockall Trough from the south of the Porcupine Bank to the Hebrides Terrace Seamount. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The results are quite promising, having recorded 47 regional and teleseismic earthquakes over a two-week deployment. These events ranged from magnitude 4.1 to 7.0 (mb) and occurred at distances up to 10??. Because these instruments were deployed at ca. 1000 m spacing we were able to resolve the geometries of two major basins from the residuals of several well-recorded teleseisms. The residuals of these arrivals, converted to basinal thickness, show a distinct westward thickening in the Bighorn Basin that agrees with industry-derived basement depth information. Our estimates of thickness in the Powder River Basin do not match industry estimates in certain areas, likely due to localized high-velocity features that are not included in our models. Thus, with a few cautions, it is clear that high-density single-component passive arrays can provide valuable constraints on basinal geometries, and could be especially useful where basinal geometry is poorly known.},

In this study, a 12-channel seismograph with signal stacking ability was used together with high frequency (100 Hz) geophones on the top-soil. The geophone intervals were set to 20 cm at the all locations. Two dimensional models were constructed by applying two dimensional inversions to the first arrival time of direct and refracted waves.

Iron enrichment may occur at the bottom of the mantle, leading to low seismic-wave velocities and high electrical conductivity, but plausible physical processes of iron enrichment have not been suggested. Diffusion-controlled iron enrichment is inefficient because it is too slow, although the diffusion can be fast enough along grain boundaries for some elements. More fundamentally, experimental studies and geophysical observations show that the core is under-saturated with oxygen, implying that the mantle next to the core should be depleted in FeO. Here we show that (Mg,Fe)O in contact with iron-rich liquids leads to a morphological instability, causing blobs of iron-rich liquid to penetrate the oxide. This morphological instability is generated by the chemical potential gradient between two materials when they are not in bulk chemical equilibrium, and should be a common process in Earth's interior. Iron-rich melt could be transported 50 to 100 kilometres away from the core-mantle boundary by this mechanism, providing an explanation for the iron-rich regions in the mantle.},

  abstract     = {Well-preserved submarine landforms from the continental shelf and fjords of northwesternmost Svalbard provide an example of ice-sheet deposition in an inter-ice-stream setting. EM1002 swath-bathymetric imagery covering 1280 km2 was examined. At the shelf edge, a distinctive and continuous belt of hummocky topography represents the grounding zone of a slow-moving Late Weichselian ice sheet. Active ice on the outer shelf is inferred from subtle lineations orientated parallel to flow. Low-amplitude transverse moraines crosscut the lineations, suggesting ice retreat across the outer shelf with brief stillstands. On the middle and inner shelf, large moraine ridges indicate multiple stillstands during deglaciation. There are arcuate moraine ridges at fjord mouths. Streamlined crag-and-tail landforms are preserved from when active full-glacial ice flowed out of the fjords. Clusters of smaller transverse ridges indicate slow retreat of grounded ice through the fjords. Holocene sedimentation is by rainout from sediment-rich meltwater, producing smooth basin fill. Small slides from the fjord walls are common. Little Ice Age glacier readvance produced another set of terminal moraines and smaller retreat moraines in the innermost fjords. A schematic model of this inter-ice-stream glacial landform assemblage summarizes the geomorphic record. It is compared with a model derived from several Svalbard cross-shelf troughs occupied by fast-flowing Late Weichselian ice streams. In general, the seafloor morphology of continental margins affected by ice streams is dominated by streamlined, subglacially produced landforms oriented in the former ice-flow direction, interrupted by major grounding-zone wedges formed during temporary halts in ice retreat. By contrast, between ice streams, shelf and fjord morphology records submarine landforms of various dimensions oriented mainly transverse to ice flow, produced at slowly retreating, grounded ice-sheet margins. There is little evidence for channeled subglacial water flow in the form of eskers and ice-contact fans on the Svalbard margin, implying that basal water is drained or advected mainly within soft subglacial sediments.},

  abstract     = {High-resolution bathymetric mapping of the fjords and continental shelf around the Svalbard archipelago shows an extensive pattern of large- and medium-scale submarine landforms formed by differences in ice-flow regimes. Mega-scale glacial lineations, lateral moraines, transverse ridges and glaciotectonic features are superimposed on the large-scale fjord, shelf and cross-shelf trough morphology of the margin. From these landforms we have inferred the flow and dynamics of the last ice sheet on Svalbard. Major fjords and their adjacent cross-shelf troughs have been identified as the main routes for ice streams draining the ice sheet. On the west coast of Svalbard major pathways existed along Bellsund, Isfjorden and Kongsfjorden. Along the northern Svalbard margin most of the ice drained through the Woodfjorden cross-shelf trough and Wijdefjorden-Hinlopen strait. Extensive areas with trough-parallel glacial lineations in the cross-shelf troughs suggest fast ice flow by palaeo-ice streams. Lateral ice-stream moraines, several tens of kilometres in length, have been mapped along the margins of some of the cross-shelf troughs, identifying the border zone between fast ice flow and stagnant or slow-flowing ice on intervening banks. Several general implications can be drawn from the interpretation of the glacier-derived submarine landforms around Svalbard. Firstly, the Late Weichselian ice sheet was partitioned into fast-flowing ice streams separated by slower moving ice. Secondly, our submarine morphological evidence supports earlier sedimentological, stratigraphical and chronological studies in implying that a large ice sheet reached the shelf edge around almost all of western and northern Svalbard in the Late Weichselian. The idea of a relatively restricted ice sheet over Svalbard, with ice-free conditions in some areas of the west coast at the Last Glacial Maximum, is therefore unlikely to be correct. Thirdly, the ice sheet appears to have retreated more rapidly from the cross-shelf troughs and outer fjords, although sometimes this occurred in a punctuated pattern indicated by grounding-zone wedges, and more slowly from the intervening shallower banks. In addition, a grounding zone for the ice sheet has been mapped at the shelfedge 10-20 km off the northwest coast of Svalbard, suggesting that ice did not reach the adjacent Yermak Plateau during the Late Weichselian.},

  abstract     = {Morphological interpretation of regional and detailed bathymetric data sets on the 2500-km-long Norwegian shelf from the North Sea (57{\{}degrees{\}}N) to Svalbard (80{\{}degrees{\}}N) has revealed a dynamic ice-flow pattern along the western margin of the Scandinavian and Barents/Svalbard ice sheets. About 20 cross-shelf troughs with megascale glacial lineations (MSGL; elongate ridges and grooves oriented parallel to trough long axes) are interpreted as former pathways for fastflowing ice streams. Studies of large-scale margin morphology and seismic profiles have identified large submarine fans at the mouths of several major cross-shelf troughs. Less dynamic ice probably existed on shallower banks. The two largest paleo-ice streams were the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream and Bear Island Trough Ice Stream, each 150-200 km wide at the mouth. The lengths of individual MSGL vary from hundreds of meters to several tens of kilometers, and the distance between ridges varies from 0.1 to 3 km. MSGL amplitudes reach 15 m, but are commonly {\textless}10 m. The onset of MSGL and, hence, fast ice flow is generally close to the outer coast, at the border zone between crystalline rocks and softer sedimentary rocks. Transverse submarine ridges on various scales, commonly parallel to the shelf edge, reflect either the maximum ice-sheet position or the recessional pattern of the ice sheet. Lateral ice-stream moraines several tens of kilometers long have also been mapped along the sides of several cross-shelf troughs, identifying the border zone between fast ice flow and stagnant or slow-flowing ice on intervening banks.},

  abstract     = {The ocean thermohaline circulation is important for transports of heat and the carbon cycle. We present results from PMIP2 coupled atmosphere-ocean simulations with four climate models that are also being used for future assessments. These models give very different glacial thermohaline circulations even with comparable circulations for present. An integrated approach using results from these simulations for Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) with proxies of the state of the glacial surface and deep Atlantic supports the interpretation from nutrient tracers that the boundary between North Atlantic Deep Water and Antarctic Bottom Water was much shallower during this period. There is less constraint from this integrated reconstruction regarding the strength of the LGM North Atlantic overturning circulation, although together they suggest that it was neither appreciably stronger nor weaker than modern. Two model simulations identify a role for sea ice in both hemispheres in driving the ocean response to glacial forcing. Citation: Otto-Bliesner, B. L., C. D. Hewitt, T. M. Marchitto, E. Brady, A.

  abstract     = {Subglacial conditions of large polar ice sheets remain poorly understood, despite recent advances in satellite observation. Major uncertainties related to basal conditions, such as the temperature field, are due to an insufficient knowledge of geothermal heat flow. Here, a hybrid method is presented that combines numerical modeling of the ice sheet thermodynamics with a priori information using a simple assimilation technique. Additional data are essentially vertical temperature profiles measured in the ice sheet at selected spots, as well as the distribution of subglacial lakes. In this way, geothermal heat-flow datasets are improved to yield calculated temperatures in accord with observations in areas where information is available. Results of the sensitivity experiments show that 55{\%} of the grounded part of the Antarctic ice sheet is at pressure melting point. Calculated basal melt rates are approximately 65Gtyear-1, which is 3{\%} of the total surface accumulation. Although these sensitivity experiments exhibit small variations in basal melt rates, the impact on the ice age of basal layers is quite important. In areas that are characterized by relatively low melt rates, this may lead to standard deviations up to 50{\%} (in a model run over a period of 106years). Subglacial water flow is concentrated underneath the large outlet glaciers of Antarctica. The larger subglacial lakes are perched at the head of these subglacial water systems. An exception, however, is the lake system of the Recovery Ice Stream Catchment, that receives a substantial amount of subglacial melt water from the upstream catchment. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

On one side of the mountains lies the Ross embayment, a submarine portion of the West Antarctic rift system. The East Antarctic Ice Sheet overlies the cratonic margin of the mountains. The Transantarctic Mountains restrict flow of the ice sheet to lower elevations within the Ross embayment. Using RADARSAT imagery, radio-echo sounding data and field-based structural data, we demonstrate that RADARSAT imagery can be used for regional structural mapping of the Transantarctic Mountains and, in particular, that bedrock structures can be traced subglacially beneath the ice-covered mountain flanks. Our analysis shows that regional structures in the mountains have provided preferred pathways for ice flow from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet across the Transantarctic Mountains barrier to the Ross embayment in West Antarctica. Further regional mapping using RADARSAT imagery has the potential to delineate the regional structural architecture of the Transantarctic Mountains and to establish the degree of spatial coupling between structures associated with mountain uplift and regional drainage patterns of the Antarctic ice sheets. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {[ 1] We present high-resolution benthic delta C-13 records from intermediate water depth core site MD01-2461 ( 1153 m water depth), from the Porcupine Seabight, NE Atlantic, spanning 43 to 8 kyr B. P. At an average proxy time step of 160 +/- 56 years this core provides information on the linkage between records from the Portuguese Margin and high-latitude North Atlantic basin, allowing additional insights into North Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC) variability during millennial-scale climatic events of the last glacial. Together, these records document both discrete and progressive reductions in Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water (GNAIW) formation preceding Heinrich ( H) events 1, 2, and 4, recorded through the apparent interchange of glacial northern and southern-sourced intermediate water signatures along the European Margin. Close coupling of NW European ice sheet (NWEIS) instability and GNAIW formation is observed through transient advances of SCW along the European margin concurrent with pulses of ice-rafted debris and meltwater release into the NE Atlantic between 27 and 16 kyr B. P., when the NWEIS was at maximum extent and proximal to Last Glacial Maximum convection zones in the open North Atlantic. It is such NWEIS instability and meltwater forcing that may have triggered reduced North Atlantic THC prior to collapse of the Laurentide ice sheet at H1 and H2. Precursory reduction in GNAIW formation prior to H4 may also be inferred. However, limited NWEIS ice volume prior to H4 and convection occurring in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea require that if a meltwater trigger is invoked, as appears to be the case at H1 and H2, the source of meltwater prior to H4 is elsewhere, likely higher-latitude ice sheets. Clarification of the sequencing and likely mechanisms of precursory decrease of the North Atlantic THC support theories of H event initiation relating to ice shelf growth during cold periods associated with reduced North Atlantic THC and subsequent ablation through subsurface warming and sea level rise associated with further reductions in meridional overturning.},

  abstract     = {Study of the interaction between uplift and erosion is a major theme of our science, but our understanding of their interplay is often limited by a lack of quantitative data. A classic example is the Colorado Plateau, for which the starting and ending points are well known: The region was at sea level in the Late Cretaceous, and now, the deeply eroded land surface is at {\~{}}2 km. The path of the landscape between these endpoints is less clear, and there has been longstanding debate on the mechanisms, amounts, and timing of uplift and erosion. We use a geographic information system to map, interpolate, and calculate the Cenozoic rock uplift and erosional exhumation of the Colorado Plateau and gain insight into its landscape development through time. Initial results indicate uplift and erosion are highly spatially variable with mean values of 2117 m for rock uplift and 406 m for net erosional exhumation since Late Cretaceous coastal sandstones were deposited. We estimate 843 m of erosion since ca. 30 Ma (a larger value because of net deposition on the plateau over the early Cenozoic), which can account for 639 m of post-Laramide rock uplift by isostatic processes. Aside from this isostatic source of rock uplift, paleobotanical and fission-track data from the larger region suggest the early Cenozoic Laramide orogeny alone should have caused more than the remaining rock uplift, and geophysical studies suggest mantle sources for additional Cenozoic uplift. There is, in fact, less uplift on the plateau than proposed sources can supply. This suggests Laramide uplift of the plateau was significantly less than that of the Rocky Mountains, consistent with its prevalent sedimentary basins, and/or that there has been little or no post-Laramide uplift beyond erosional isostasy.},

  abstract     = {Source parameter inversion of P and SH waveforms and amplitudes for 20 shallow earthquakes using a singlular value decomposition technique provides important constraints on the tectonics and relative plate motions of the Scotia Sea region. The derived focal mechanisms show both thrust and strike-slip faulting along the North Scotia Ridge and normal and strike-slip faulting along the South Scotia Ridge. Two thrust faulting mechanisms south of Tierra del Fuego indicate diffuse convergence of the Antarctic plate along the western margin of the Scotia plate. Earthquakes are consistent with active subduction and back arc spreading along the South Shetland Trench and Bransfield Strait. The dephs of two earthquakes (35 km and 55 km) and one shallow thrust faulting event suggest continued subduction along the South Shetland Trench, but the underthrusting is largely aseismic due to the young plate age and slow subduction rate. The magnitude and depth of normal faulting earthquakes along Bransfield Strait and the South Scotia Ridge are suggestive of diffuse extension rather than typical organized mid-ocean spreading, which is generally associated with smaller and shallower earthquakes. Eight strike-slip and thrust faulting events provide well-constrained slip vectors showing Scotia plate motion relative to the surrounding larger plates. Using a four-plate model (Scotia (SC), South Sandwich (SS), Antarctica (AN) and South America (SA)) and a fixed SA-AN Euler vector, we inverted these data together with published centroid moment tensor slip vectors along the South Sandwich Trench and published marine magnetic data from the SS back arc spreading center to derive the first quantitative plate motion model for the Scotia region. The SC-SA Euler pole is located in the South Atlantic and shows large latitudinal uncertainties. The SC-AN pole is better constrained and located in the Weddell Sea. These results predict left-lateral strike-slip motion with a component of compression along the North Scotia Ridge, left-lateral strike-slip with a component of extension along the South Scotia Ridge, and east-west compression in Drake Passage. Although no rate data have been published connecting the Scotia plate with the global plate system, Euler vector magnitudes are obtained through closure. The results, though poorly constrained, suggest relative motion rates of 0.5 cm/yr along the North Scotia Ridge and 1.0 cm/yr along the South Scotia Ridge and in Drake Passage.},

  abstract     = {The budget of global sea level rise includes contributions from several distinct factors, including thermosteric effects, the wasting of small ice sheets and glaciers, and the loss of mass by the great polar ice sheets and by the continents due to desiccation. Since the former contribution may be estimated on the basis of both hydrographic survey data and more recently using Argo float data, the second may be estimated on the basis of mass balance measurements on existing ice-fields, and the latter on the basis of modern GRACE-based time dependent gravity field measurements, the inputs to the globally averaged rate of sea level rise may be directly constrained. Since GRACE also provides a measurement of the rate at which mass is being added to the oceans, we are now in a position to ask whether this rate of mass addition to the oceans matches the rate at which mass is being removed from the continents. As demonstrated herein, the mass component of the budget of global sea level is closed within the observational errors. When the mass-derived contribution is added to the thermosteric contribution it is furthermore shown that the inference of the net rate of global sea level rise by the altimetric satellites Topex/Poseidon and Jason 1 is also reconcilable over the GRACE era. It is noted those individual terms in the budget, especially the contribution from small ice sheets and glaciers, remains insufficiently accurate. It is demonstrated that the lingering influence of the Late Quaternary ice-age upon sea level is profound and that closure of the budget requires an accurate model of its impact. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The flaw concerns a previously noted inability of the model to simultaneously reconcile the VLBI and GPS measured rates of vertical and horizontal motion in the region of the North American continent that lay outboard and to the south of the Laurentide Ice-Sheet (LIS) at Last Glacial Maximum. This characteristic misfit of the model to the data has been suggested to be reconcilable only by recourse to models that explicitly incorporate the influence of lateral viscosity heterogeneity. It is demonstrated herein that, on the contrary, this flaw is entirely and unambiguously attributable to the rheological stratification of the lithosphere, an influence not previously accounted for in global models of the GIA process but which must exist on a priori grounds.},

In order to address the important issue of the variation of continental ice volume and related changes in global sea level through the late glacial period, we employ an extended set of observations of the pre-glacial and postglacial history of sea-level rise at the island of Barbados, together with a refined model of continental deglaciation and an accurate methodology for the prediction of postglacial sea-level change. Although our results provide unambiguous evidence that the post LGM rise of eustatic sea-level was very close to the widely supported estimate of 120 m, the data also provide evidence that LGM must have occurred 26,000 years ago, approximately 5000 yr earlier than the usually assumed age. ?? 2006.},

Such remotely triggered seismic activity mostly occurs in tectonically active regions. Triggered seismicity is generally considered to reflect shear failure on critically stressed fault planes and is thought to be driven by dynamic stress perturbations from both Love and Rayleigh types of surface seismic wave(2). Here we analyse seismic data from Antarctica in the six hours leading up to and following the 2010 M-w 8.8 Maule earthquake in Chile. We identify many high-frequency seismic signals during the passage of the Rayleigh waves generated by the Maule earthquake, and interpret them as small icequakes triggered by the Rayleigh waves. The source locations of these triggered icequakes are difficult to determine owing to sparse seismic network coverage, but the triggered events generate surface waves, so are probably formed by near-surface sources. Our observations are consistent with tensile fracturing of near-surface ice or other brittle fracture events caused by changes in volumetric strain as the high-amplitude Rayleigh waves passed through. We conclude that cryospheric systems can be sensitive to large distant earthquakes.},

  abstract     = {The basement in the Pointe Geologie Archipelago, around the French Dumont D'Urville station in Terre Adelie, comprises a metapelitic migmatitic complex with a 1.7 Ga metamorphic evolution differing from that generally found in other areas of the East Antarctic Shield. In Terre Adelie, although the oldest crustal precursors (Nd T(DM) model ages) are ca. 2.2-2.4 Ga old, inherited zircon SHRIMP ages are ca. 1.73-1.76, 2.6 and 2.8 Ga. The migmatitic evolution is restricted to a single event which is dated at 1.69 Ga by newly formed zircons (SHRIMP) and by U-Pb and 207Pb/206Pb evaporation TIMS ages of monazite. When interpreted as cooling ages, Sm-Nd garnet (1.60 Ga) and Rb-Sr micas (1.50 Ga) ages would be indicative of a slow cooling rate, suggestive of a long-lived major thermal anomaly. Geological processes such as sediment deposition, HT-LP metamorphism and anatexis and coeval intrusion of mafic magmas occurred during a very short time. This suggests that the migmatite complex is related to a major lithospheric thinning associated with a thermal anomaly coeval with syn-metamorphic mafic magmatism. Such thinning may have developed in a 2.8/2.4 Ga old basement, comparable with the Port Martin formations located 50 km further east. In the Gawler Craton (South Australia) similar units are found which could have formed, together with the Terre Adelie basement, as a single shield by a collage of various terrains that existed prior to ca. 1.5 to 1.6 Ga ago, comprising the 'Mawson Continent'.},

  abstract     = {in many areas of Svalbard, the Neoglacial terminal deposits represent the Holocene glacial maximum. The glaciers began the retreat from their Neoglacial maximum positions around 1900 AD. Based on high resolution acoustic data and sediment cores, sedimentation patterns in four tidewater glacier-influenced inlets of the fjord Isfjorden (Tempelfjorden, Billefjorden, Yoldiabukta and Borebukta), Spitsbergen, were investigated. A model for sedimentation of tidewater glaciers in these High Arctic environments is proposed. Glacigenic deposits occur in proximal and distal basins. The proximal basins comprise morainal ridges and hummocky moraines, bounded by terminal moraines marking the maximum Neoglacial ice extent. The distal basins are characterized by debris lobes and draping stratified glacimarine sediments beyond, and to some extent beneath and above, the lobes. The debris lobe in Tempelfjorden is composed of massive clayey silt with scattered clasts. Distal glacimarine sediments comprise stratified clayey silt with low ice-rafted debris (IRD) content. The average sedimentation rate for the glacimarine sediments in Tempelfjorden is 17 mm/yr for the last ca. 130 years. It is suggested that the stratified sediments in Tempelfjorden are glacimarine varves. The high sedimentation rate and low IRD content are explained by input from rivers, in addition to sedimentation from suspension of glacial meltwater. The debris lobes in Borebukta are composed of massive clayey silt with high clast content. Distal glacimarine sediments in Yoldiabukta comprise clayey silt with high IRD content. The average sedimentation rate for these sediments is 0.6 mm/yr for the last 2300 years.},

Carbon-14 wiggle-match dating was used to produce an accurate chronology for part of an early Holocene peat sequence from the Borchert (The Netherlands). Following the Younger Dryas--Preboreal transition, two climatic shifts could be inferred. Around 11 400 cal. yr BP the expansion of birch (Betula) forest was interrupted by a dry continental phase with dominantly open grassland vegetation, coeval with the PBO (Preboreal Oscillation), as observed in the GRIP ice core. At 11 250 cal. yr BP a sudden shift to a humid climate occurred. This second change appears to be contemporaneous with: (i) a sharp increase of atmospheric 14C; (ii) a temporary decline of atmospheric CO2; and (iii) an increase in the GRIP 10Be flux.

  abstract     = {Late Riphean to early Vendian metasedimentary rocks of the Offerdal Nappe, central Scandinavian Caledonides, were studied by field mapping and measured sections. Even though the rocks have been metamorphosed and tectonically deformed, preserved sedimentary structures and outcrop exposure permit the interpretation of a little-known area with respect to the break-up of Rodinia. This work shows that although the primary sedimentary textures are strongly altered during metamorphism the primary sedimentary structures and bed geometries are commonly preserved. Moreover, the sedimentary structures, where identified, can be used to hydrodynamically estimate the primary grain-size of the metasedimentary rocks. Seven sedimentary facies were identified in three tectonostratigraphic units. The lower tectonostratigraphic unit consists of polymict conglomerates deposited in alluvial fans. The lower part of the middle tectonostratigraphic unit consists of channelled turbidite deposits. The upper part of the middle tectonostratigraphic unit consists of a regressive to transgressive succession with southeast to northwest transition from fluvial deposits, to storm-dominated deposits and into offshore mudstones. The lower part of the upper tectonostratigraphic unit consists of a regressive succession with southeast to northwest transition from channelled turbidites into sheet-like turbidites. The upper part consists of fluvial deposits in updip (southeast) areas, whereas in downdip (northwest) areas the sheet-like turbidites reflect continued deepwater deposition. (1) The $\sim$1500 m thickness of the Offerdal succession, (2) the occurrence of {\textgreater}300 m thickness of the pebble- to boulder-bearing continental-basement derived alluvial fan conglomerates, (3) the high sediment input rates, and (4) the high subsidence rates suggest an actively subsiding basin and a relatively uplifted hinterland. Furthermore, the arkosic composition of the Offerdal metasandstones, as well as the Precambrian porphyry, syenite and quartzite clast composition of the lithic conglomerates, recognised from the subjacent continental basement of Baltica, suggest a continental sediment source. The rapid accommodation changes, and especially the simultaneous subsidence of downdip areas and uplift of updip areas in UTU2 suggest syn-depositional extensional block rotation. Collectively, this evidence suggests that the Offerdal succession was deposited in a continental rift basin related to break-up of Rodinia. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The isotope cycles are counted in the ice-core record using a model that neglects short-wavelength and low-amplitude cycles. We find approximately the same number of delta(18)O cycles as years between known reference horizons, and assume these cycles represent annual cycles. Testing the validity of this assumption using cycles in deltaD shows that both records give similar numbers of cycles. Using the delta(18)O chronology, and decompressing the accumulation records using the Nye flow model, we calculate the annual accumulation for the ice-core site back to AD 1715. We find that the average accumulation rate from 1715 to 1950 was on average 0.30 in w.e. Accumulation rates increased about 25{\%} during the later part of the 20\textsuperscript{th} century to an average of 0.41 in w.e. for the period 1950-97.

  abstract     = {Geotherm families in which surface heat flow is the principal independent variable have been constructed for continental and oceanic lithospheres. The continental model is characterized by geotherms in which surface heat flow is in equilibrium with heat flowing into the lithosphere at its base plus heat generated by radioactive decay within the lithosphere. The model accommodates the regional variation of the surface heat flow with proportional variations in the radioactivity of the surficial enriched zone and in the deeper heat flow. The proportionality is dictated by a new and general linear relationship between reduced heat flow and mean heat flow for a region (q* ??? 0.6 q ??0), which enables both q* and the mean heat production of the enriched zone to be estimated from knowledge of the mean surface heat flow of a province. The oceanic model is characterized by the transient cooling of a semi-infinite medium with an initial temperature gradient and some near-surface radiogenic heat production. The model yields a heat flow in satisfactory agreement with observations in the oldest ocean basins. The depth at which both the oceanic and continental geotherms reach {\~{}}0.85 of the melting temperature is shown to be a consistent estimator of the depth to the top of the low-velocity channel, or the thickness of the high-velocity lid overlying the channel. We identify the lid as synonymous with the lithosphere, and produce a global map of lithospheric thickness based on the regional variation of surface heat flow. The lithosphere is less than 100 km thick over most of the globe, but thickens appreciably and becomes more viscous beneath the Precambrian shields and platforms, regions of low heat flow. These characteristics of shields are consistent with recently reported models of the driving mechanisms of the plate system, which require greater retarding forces beneath plates with large continental areas. ?? 1977.},

The sudden growth of major ice across the Eocene-Oligocene boundary ($\sim$34 Ma) is used as a test bed for this sensitivity. A suite of several million year-long simulations spanning the transition is performed, with various geothermal heat flux magnitudes and spatial distributions reflecting current uncertainty. The climate-ice sheet model simulates the Eocene-Oligocene transition realistically as a non-linear ice-sheet response to orbital perturbations and a long-term gradual decline of atmospheric CO2. It is found that reasonable variations of geothermal heat flux have very little effect on overall ice volumes and extents, and on the timing of major ice transitions. However, they cause large changes in basal areas at the pressure melting point at a given time, which could strongly influence other aspects of Cenozoic Antarctic evolution such as basal hydrology, sediment deformation and discharge, subglacial lakes, and basal erosional forms. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {The area around Trondheim Bay in central Norway is affected by landslides, both onshore and within the fjord, with several events documented to have occurred in the last century. As urban development, including land reclamation, is taking place in the harbor, assessing in situ soil conditions is paramount for infrastructure and operational safety. To obtain better insight into the harbor setting in terms of subsurface structures and potential coastal geo-hazards, a high-resolution multichannel {\{}SH{\}}-wave seismic-reflection land survey was carried out during summer 2008, which complements a dense network of high-resolution, single-channel marine seismic profiles over the deltaic sediments in the fjord. The {\{}SH{\}}-wave seismic reflection was chosen because the resulting interval shear-wave velocity provides a nearly direct proxy for in situ soil stiffness, a key geotechnical parameter. In total, 4.2 km of 2.5D {\{}SH{\}}-wave profiles was acquired along roads and parking places. Highly resolved images of the sediments were obtained, overlying the bedrock at a depth of about 150 m. The high quality of the data is ascribed to the quieter ambient noise conditions of the nighttime data collection and an efficient suppression of Love waves arising from the presence of a high-velocity layer at the surface. Five main stratigraphic units were identified based on reflection patterns and amplitudes. Distinct {\{}SH{\}}-wave reflection events enabled detailed S-wave velocity determination down to the bedrock. Subsequently, interval velocities were remapped into soil stiffness. Low S-wave velocities of about 100 m/s occurring in the upper 50 m of the fjord-deltaic sediment succession suggest low sediment stiffness (50 to 100 {\{}MPa{\}}) directly below the stiffer man-made fill that is 10 to 15 m thick. The results indicate that {\{}SH{\}}-wave seismic reflection is well suited for urban ground investigation.},

This notion contrasts with the prevailing view that the Arctic Ocean was covered only by perennial sea ice with scattered icebergs. Detailed mapping of the ocean floor is the best means to resolve this issue. Although sea-floor imagery has been used to reconstruct the glacial history of the Antarctic shelf, little data have been collected in the Arctic Ocean because of operational constraints. The use of a geophysical mapping system during the submarine SCICEX expedition in 1999 provided the opportunity to perform such an investigation over a large portion of the Arctic Ocean. Here we analyse backscatter images and sub-bottom profiler records obtained during this expedition from depths as great as 1 kilometre. These records show multiple bedforms indicative of glacial scouring and moulding of sea floor, combined with large-scale erosion of submarine ridge crests. These distinct glaciogenic features demonstrate that immense, Antarctic-type ice shelves up to 1 kilometre thick and hundreds of kilometres long existed in the Arctic Ocean during Pleistocene glaciations.},

Accurate dating of the diamicton$\backslash$nis not attainable, but the correlation of pre-diamict sediments to$\backslash$nwell-dated sections in the Laptev Sea, and available C-14 ages from$\backslash$nsediments on top of the diamicton, indicate its LGM age.

While there persists a fundamental tradeoff between horizontal and vertical resolution due to the components of the wave train analyzed, advances in joint inversions are continuing to refine the tomographic images generated with USArray. The DNA13 model incorporates teleseismic P observations, independent SH and SV observations, and surface-wave phase velocities from both teleseismic earthquakes and ambient noise to constrain the relative wave-speed from the crust down into the lower mantle. We address the validity of our models through forward prediction of observables and compare the predictive power of the DNA13 models to other models. In the shallow portion of DNA13, we image the Archean age Wyoming Province, which exhibits evidence of ocean closure at its northern and southern ends. The Llano Province in Central Texas is of Grenville age and still contains lithospheric evidence of subduction as the province accreted to North America. Comparison of these two provinces highlights the role of fossil slabs as part of the cratonic architecture. Analysis of the deep portion of the models highlights variations within the Farallon plate, including two distinct high wave-speed anomalies in the eastern U.S. and a shallow feature in the center of these two anomalies.

East Gondwana remained in low latitudes for the rest of the Neoproterozoic, while Laurentia moved to polar latitudes by 580 Ma. During the Vendian, a wide Pacific Ocean separated the two continental land masses. The younger Marinoan, Ice Brook, and Varangian glaciations in the early Vendian preceded a second continental breakup in the late Vendian, causing formation of the eastern margin of Laurentia and rejuvenation of its western margin. Paleomagnetic data indicate that Gondwana was not fully assembled until the end of the Neoproterozoic, possibly as late as Middle Cambrian.},

  abstract     = {The role of surface freshwater flux boundary conditions in prognostic Arctic Ocean/sea-ice modelling is analysed, using a regional numerical model. Three different applications of freshwater flux formulations are evaluated. The standard formulation, which serves as a benchmark, takes surface volume fluxes due to precipitation, evaporation and river runoff into account. The total freshwater input to the Arctic Ocean by runoff, precipitation and Bering Strait inflow is approximately 6800 km3 yr-1 in the model setup. The implementation of an Arctic river water tracer in the standard run enables the calculation of an average mean residence time of 14-15 years for river water in the Arctic halocline. The second formulation for surface freshwater fluxes neglects the volume input, which corresponds to applying 'virtual salinity fluxes'. This simplification leads to a rapid salinity build-up in the upper layers of the Arctic Ocean and causes a substantial reduction of freshwater export through Fram Strait. The third formulation uses a constant reference salinity of 35 psu in the definition of the virtual salinity flux boundary condition. This approach results in hydrographic fields which are very similar to those from the standard run. Errors in circulation and freshwater transport are small and, for most applications, tolerable. Our results suggest that virtual salinity fluxes with fixed reference salinity are a reasonable approximation for Arctic Ocean models with horizontal resolution of order 100 km. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The resulting oceanic states are perturbed by North Atlantic meltwater inputs in order to simulate the effect of Heinrich Events on the Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC) and SST. The experiments show that both the Atlantic SST signature of the meltwater event and the time span of THC recovery strongly depend on the climatic background state. Data-model comparison reveals that the overall spatial signature of SST anomalies is captured much better in the glacial meltwater experiments than in an analogous experiment under present-day conditions. In particular, a breakdown of the modern THC would induce a much stronger temperature drop in high northern latitudes than did Heinrich Events during the ice age. Moreover, our results suggest that the present-day circulation can settle into a stable 'off' mode, whereas the glacial THC was mono-stable. Mono-stability may serve as an explanation for the recovery of the THC after Heinrich Event shutdowns during the Last Glaciation. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

U/Th dates of peat deposited during the final phase of the Last Interglacial indicate that it lasted until at least c. 115 000 yr ago. The Early Wurmian started with a period of severe cold climate causing a substitution of forest by tundra-like vegetation. It is assumed that during this period glaciers advanced to the margin of the foreland of at least the Western Alps. Sediments attributed to this glaciation are dated to about 103 000 yr. Three subsequent interstadials, all characterized by coniferous forest, were interrupted by cold stadials with steppe to tundra-like vegetation. The first interstadial is dated to about 95 000 yr. There is evidence for an interstadial with open coniferous woodland and three phases of steppe vegetation during the Middle Wurmian, between c. 50 000 and 30 000 yr ago. The last glaciation of the Alpine Foreland reached its maximum extension between 24 000 and 21 500 yr and glaciers rapidly collapsed before similar to17 500 yr ago. A series of minor re-advances during the Lateglacial is reported from within the Alps, but the glaciers barely reached the main Alpine valleys during this time. The last of these advances formed the Egesen moraine and occurred at about 11 800 yr ago during the Younger Dryas.},

The average insolation during the key summer months (M, J, J) was ca 11{\%} above present across the Northern Hemisphere between 130,000 and 127,000 years ago, with a slightly greater anomaly, 13{\%}, over the Arctic. Greater summer insolation, early penultimate deglaciation, and intensification of the North Atlantic Drift, combined to reduce Arctic Ocean sea ice, allow expansion of boreal forest to the Arctic Ocean shore across vast regions, reduce permafrost, and melt almost all glaciers in the Northern Hemisphere. Insolation, amplified by key boundary condition feedbacks, collectively produced Last Interglacial summer temperature anomalies 4-5 ??C above present over most Arctic lands, significantly above the average Northern Hemisphere anomaly. The Last Interglaciation demonstrates the strength of positive feedbacks on Arctic warming and provides a potentially conservative analogue for anticipated future greenhouse warming. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The velocity maps are inverted for shear velocities across the region using a niching genetic algorithm. We observe only minor variation in crustal velocities beneath East Antarctica and the Transantarctic Mountains, and velocities are similar to those observed for Precambrian crust worldwide. Low velocities, which may be related to the presence of sediment, are observed at shallow depths beneath the Wilkes Subglacial Basin and the Aurora Subglacial Basin, but dispersion curves show that sediment thickness must be limited to less than about 2 km. In the Ross Sea, we observe low velocities at shallow depths from thick sediments and high velocities approaching mantle values between 16 and 20 km depth.},

The width of the hysteresis curves varies between 0.2 and 0.5 Sv in the models. Major differences are found in the location of present-day climate on the hysteresis diagram. In seven of the models, present-day climate for standard parameter choices is found in the bi-stable regime, in four models this climate is in the mono-stable regime.

The extremes of cyclone intensity increases significantly in winter in almost all regions, which is related to a stronger meridional temperature gradient and an increase in lower tropospheric baroclinicity. Extremes of cyclone intensity in subregions of the North Atlantic are related to extremes in precipitation and in wind speed during winter. Moreover, extremes of cyclone intensity are also connected to distinct large-scale atmospheric patterns for the different subregions, but these relationships vanish during summer. Analyzing the mean 1,000 hPa geopotential height change of the Maunder Minimum simulations compared with the control simulation, we find a similar pattern as the correlation pattern with the cyclone intensity index of the southern Europe cyclones. This illustrates that changes in the atmospheric high-frequency, i.e., the simulated southward shift of cyclones in the North Atlantic and the related increase of extreme precipitation and wind speed in particular in the Mediterranean in winter, are associated with large-scale atmospheric circulation changes.},

  abstract     = {The Greenland ice core records show that the overall cold climate of the last glacial period was repeatedly interrupted by short, rapid warmings. The events, known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events, are strongly imprinted in the North Atlantic marine records suggesting that they were linked to North Atlantic circulation changes. However, the causes of the D-O events are poorly understood and they represent one of the most intriguing puzzles of the last glacial period. In order to investigate a possible mechanism we have studied variations in the distribution of benthic and planktonic foraminifera, oxygen isotopes and ice rafted debris during the last glacial period in eight cores from the North Atlantic and the Nordic Seas taken at mid depth from 853 to 1760 m. The parameters indicate, in agreement with previous studies, that the circulation system during the interstadials resembled the present system. Atlantic surface water flowed north into the Nordic Seas, where most of it sank through convection and, as cold deep water, flowed back into the North Atlantic. During the stadials, a halocline was established in the Nordic Seas and in the northernmost part of the North Atlantic and the outflow from the Nordic Seas stopped. However, below the cold, light surface layer, the relatively warm water of the North Atlantic Drift continued to flow across the North Atlantic and into the Nordic Seas, here warming up the deep-water masses. We suggest that the warm water gradually made the water column unstable. The pivotal abrupt climate warmings were caused by sudden upwelling of the deep, warm water masses causing overturning of the entire water column and onset of convection. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Due to length limitations, we cannot hope to cover every aspect of this diverse topic or include mathematical derivations of the underlying principles; rather, we will provide a largely descriptive coverage of the methodology that is targeted at readers not intimately familiar with the topic. The relative merits of local versus global parameterization, ray tracing versus wavefront tracking, backprojection versus gradient based inversion and synthetic testing versus model covariance are explored. A variety of key application areas are also discussed, including body wave traveltime tomography, surface wave tomography, attenuation tomography and ambient noise tomography. Established and emerging trends, many of which are driven by the ongoing rapid increases in available computing power, will also be examined, including finite frequency tomography, full waveform tomography and joint tomography using multiple datasets. Several practical applications of seismic tomography, including body wave traveltime, attenuation and surface waveform, are presented in order to reinforce prior discussion of theory. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

New broadband seismic stations were established at the remote sites of the SSCUA deployment, which ran between the austral summers of 2002/2003 and 2004/ 2005. Recorded energy from distant earthquakes is used to calculate receiver function waveforms that are then modelled to deduce the seismic structure of the upper lithosphere. The results of this study are two-fold. Firstly, seismic structure and crustal depth are determined beneath the Lambert Glacier region providing constraints on its tectonic evolution. A significant contrast in crustal depth is found between the Northern and Southern Prince Charles Mountains that may indicate the location of a major tectonic boundary. Secondly, baseline seismic receiver structures are established for the Rayner, Fisher and Lambert terranes that may be traced beneath the Antarctic ice sheet in the future. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

High-fidelity waveforms from teleseismic earthquakes recorded at stations CASY and DRV (1996-2001) are used to calculate the seismic receiver function, the signal produced as energy passes through layers in the seismic velocity structure under the receiving station. The receiver functions are stacked to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and then modelled using an inverse algorithm to find the structure that best fits the observed waveform at each station. Inferences are made regarding the tectonic structure, in particular, the crustal thickness and character of the seismic Moho.The crustal thickness under Casey Station is found to be 30 km (+/- 2 km) with a fairly sharp Moho, considerably less than Dumont D'Urville Station, where the crustal thickness is 42 km, and there is a significant low velocity region in the deep crust. The structure of the Wilkes Land lithosphere is comparable to that of the Albany-Fraser Orogen, Western Australia, part of its conjugate margin. This places a new constraint on the relative position of East Antarctica and Australia in the reconstruction of Gondwana, and earlier, supercontinents. A recent reinterpretation of Antarctic geology proposes tectonic province boundaries trending perpendicular to the coast with counterparts in southern Australia. Seismic techniques, determining structure beneath regions with no surface exposure, are vital tools in testing such tectonic hypotheses, towards the reconstruction of Gondwana to full lithospheric depth.},

The previously held notion that Antarctica is essentially aseismic has been disproved by using records from established Global Seismic Network stations and recently deployed temporary stations on the Antarctic continent. However, the seismicity observed in Antarctica is very low in comparison with other continental intraplate regions. This contribution critically reviews magnitude threshold levels for recorded earthquakes and the available earthquake hypo-center data for Antarctica and the surrounding oceans. Patterns are identified in the distribution of Antarctic earthquakes and the deformation of the Antarctic plate, and the interplay between tectonic and ice-related forces controlling this distribution is discussed. In the continental intraplate region of Antarctica, earthquakes occur in three settings. Two are likely to have distributions with a tectonic control (although the level may be suppressed by ice cover)--those in the Transantarctic Mountains and scattered events in the interior. Finally, seismicity in the coastal zone and continental margin is likely to be most strongly controlled by the interaction between glacial isostatic adjustment and lithospheric thickness, with a regional tectonic component in some locations.},

  abstract      = {Seismic anisotropy is investigated across the previously unstudied region of central East Antarctica including new coastal locations and remote, temporary stations far inland. Shear-wave splitting parameters are determined using core refracted phases from earthquakes occurring at teleseismic distances. New results are obtained from stations of the SSCUA temporary deployment in central East Antarctica (the greater Lambert Glacier basin) and also from permanent stations at Mawson and Casey. The pattern, for the coastal stations, shows that the orientation of the polarisation plane of the fast S-wave is parallel to the general trend of the continental margin of central East Antarctica. The remote stations, further inland, show fast directions that are not parallel to the continental margin and change more from station to station. These results are discussed, together with previous results of shear-wave splitting studies from other regions of East Antarctica in the light of a revised absolute plate motion (APM). In Dronning Maud Land and Victoria Land, the APM vectors are larger than in the Lambert Glacier region and strain associated with mantle flow could be contributing to observed anisotropy in these regions. The margin-parallel anisotropy observed at the coastal stations in central East Antarctica is likely to be caused by a combination of pre-existing lineations, and an additional component associated with trans-tensional rifting at the breakup of Gondwana. The more variable fast directions of the inland stations are likely to be caused by upper lithospheric remnant anisotropy of ancient lithospheric blocks, possibly with a component from the failed rifting associated with the trans-tensional basin of the present-day Lambert Glacier. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {The present distribution in Greenland of iceberg-producing outlet glaciers in the south and floating glaciers with bottom melting in the north is most likely controlled by the large contrast in climate. The Holocene glacial geological record in East Greenland shows that the boundary between the two types of outlet glaciers has moved up and down the coast in response to climate change. The difference in outlet glacier extent and dominant ablation mechanism is determinate for where ice rafted debris (IRD) contained in the bottom layers of the glaciers will be released by bottom melting. The icebergs (ice islands), presently detached from the northern floating glaciers are during long periods retained by semi-permanent sea ice, and will only occasionally escape to the sea. When eventually released, the ice islands contain little-if any-debris, as the debris contained in the bottom layer has already been released by intensive sub-glacial melting during the long stay of the ice-islands in coastal waters. The Holocene glacial geological record from Northeast Greenland is compared to the record of ice rafted debris (IRD) from North Atlantic deep-sea sediment cores. The comparison shows that transport by icebergs in the form of basal debris is unlikely to be the dominant transport mechanism of IRD to deposition sites in the North Atlantic during the Holocene. The ice rafted debris is more likely to be carried at the surface of sea- (or glacier) ice. This supports the result of previous studies by other workers that changes of atmospheric and ocean-surface circulation and temperature are the likely causes of Holocene cycles in IRD concentration in North Atlantic deep-sea sediments. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Multimillennia records of glacier length fluctuations for Nigardsbreen (Norway) and Rhonegletscher (Switzerland) are simulated using autoregressive processes determined by statistically downscaled GCM experiments. Return periods and probabilities of specific glacier length changes using GCM integrations excluding external forcings such as solar irradiation changes, volcanic, or anthropogenic effects are analyzed and compared to historical glacier length records. Preindustrial fluctuations of the glaciers as far as observed or reconstructed, including their advance during the "Little Ice Age, '' can be explained by internal variability in the climate system as represented by a GCM. However, fluctuations comparable to the present-day glacier retreat exceed any variation simulated by the GCM control experiments and must be caused by external forcing, with anthropogenic forcing being a likely candidate.},

  abstract     = {The response of the climate at high northern latitudes to slowly changing external forcings was studied in a 9,000-year long simulation with the coupled atmosphere-sea ice-ocean-vegetation model ECBilt-CLIO-VECODE. Only long-term changes in insolation and atmospheric CO2 and CH4 content were prescribed. The experiment reveals an early optimum (9--8{~}kyr BP) in most regions, followed by a 1--3{$^{\circ}$}C decrease in mean annual temperatures, a reduction in summer precipitation and an expansion of sea-ice cover. These results are in general agreement with proxy data. Over the continents, the timing of the largest temperature response in summer coincides with the maximum insolation difference, while over the oceans, the maximum response is delayed by a few months due to the thermal inertia of the oceans, placing the strongest cooling in the winter half year. Sea ice is involved in two positive feedbacks (ice-albedo and sea-ice insulation) that lead regionally to an amplification of the thermal response in our model (7{$^{\circ}$}C cooling in Canadian Arctic). In some areas, the tundra-taiga feedback results in intensified cooling during summer, most notably in northern North America. The simulated sea-ice expansion leads in the Nordic Seas to less deep convection and local weakening of the overturning circulation, producing a maximum winter temperature reduction of 7{$^{\circ}$}C. The enhanced interaction between sea ice and deep convection is accompanied by increasing interannual variability, including two marked decadal-scale cooling events. Deep convection intensifies in the Labrador Sea, keeping the overall strength of the thermohaline circulation stable throughout the experiment.},

  abstract     = {We present and discuss a new model of the crust and upper mantle at high southern latitudes that is produced from a large, new data set of fundamental mode surface wave dispersion measurements. The inversion for a 2degrees x 2degrees shear velocity model breaks into two principal steps: first, surface wave tomography in which dispersion maps are produced for a discrete set of periods for each wave type (Rayleigh group velocity, 18-175 s; Love group velocity, 20-150 s; Rayleigh and Love phase velocity, 40-150 s) and, second, inversion for a shear velocity model. In the first step, we estimate average resolution at high southern latitudes to be about 600 km for Rayleigh waves and 700 km for Love waves. The second step is a multistage process that culminates in a Monte Carlo inversion yielding an ensemble of acceptable models at each spatial node. The middle of the ensemble (median model) together with the half width of the corridor defined by the ensemble summarize the results of the inversion. The median model fits the dispersion maps at about the measurement error (group velocities, 20-25 m/s; phase velocities, 10-15 m/s) and the dispersion data themselves at about twice the measurement error. We refer to the features that appear in every member of the ensemble as "persistent." Some of persistent features are the following: (1) Crustal thickness averages similar to27 km in West Antarctica and similar to40 km in East Antarctica, with maximum thicknesses approaching 45 km. (2) Although the East Antarctic craton displays variations in both maximum velocity and thickness, it appears to be a more or less average craton. (3) The upper mantle beneath much of West Antarctica is slow and beneath the West Antarctic Rift is nearly indistinguishable from currently dormant extensional regions such as the western Mediterranean and the Sea of Japan. Our model is therefore consistent with evidence of active volcanism underlying the West Antarctic ice sheet, and we hypothesize that the West Antarctic Rift is the remnant of events of lithospheric rejuvenation in the recent past that are now quiescent. (4) The Australian-Antarctic Discordance is characterized by a moderately high velocity lid to a depth of 70-80 km with low velocities wrapping around the discordance to the south. There is a weak trend of relatively high velocities dipping to the west at greater depths that requires further concentrated efforts to resolve. (5) The strength of radial anisotropy (nu(sh) - nus(nu))/nus(nu) in the uppermost mantle across the Southern Hemisphere averages similar to4{\%}, similar to the Preliminary Reference Earth Model. Radial anisotropy appears to be slightly stronger in West Antarctica than in East Antarctica and in the thinner rather than the thicker regions of the East Antarctic craton.},

Regional ice flow patterns in the vicinity of Sisimiut show an enlarged ice sheet that extended southwestwards on to the shelf, with an ice stream centred over Holsteinsborg dyb. High level periglacial terrain composed of blockfield and tors is dated to between 101 and 142 ka using 26Al and 10Be cosmogenic exposure ages. These limit the maximum surface elevation of the Last Glacial Maximum ice sheet in this part of southwest Greenland to ca 750-810 m asl, and demonstrate that terrain above this level has been ice free since MIS 6. Last Glacial Maximum ice thickness on the coast of ca 700 m implies that the ice sheet reached the mid to outer continental shelf edge to form the Outer Hellefisk moraines. Exposure dates record ice surface thinning from 21.0 to 9.8 ka, with downwasting rates varying from 0.06 to 0.12 m yr-1. This reflects strong surface ablation associated with increased air temperatures running up to the B??lling Interstadial (GIS1e) at ca 14 ka, and later marine calving under high sea levels. The relatively late retreat of the Itilleq ice stream inland of the present coastline is similar to the pattern observed at Jakobshavn Isbr??, located 250 km north in Disko Bugt, which also retreated from the continental shelf after ca 10 ka. We hypothesise that the ice streams of West Greenland persisted on the inner shelf until the early Holocene because of their considerable ice thickness and greater ice discharge compared with the adjacent ice sheet. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract     = {The volume of Earth's continental crust depends on the rate of addition of continental crust from the mantle compared to the rate of continental loss back to the mantle, which at present is roughly balanced. Models for the growth rate of continental crust vary, with isotope data suggesting various episodes of increased growth rate throughout Earth's history; these episodes have been correlated with the supercontinent cycle, but may be a consequence of preferential preservation of continental crust during these cycles. The global balance between addition and loss of continental crust is controlled by: 1) the extent of internal orogens versus exterior orogens, with the latter favouring continental addition, and 2) the balance between exterior orogens in retreating mode versus those in advancing mode, with the latter favouring continental loss. A greater balance of continental addition versus loss should exist during supercontinent break-up, due to a high magmatic flux in retreating accretionary orogens, whereas the amalgamation of supercontinents should involve increased continental loss due to increased sediment subduction and tectonic erosion. Zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopes provide insight to models of crustal growth rate since they sample the continental crust at their time of formation. Using the distribution of data within ??Hf (t)-time space of a global zircon database, it is demonstrated that the data are in accord with the concept of increased continental loss during supercontinent amalgamation. Periods featuring increased continental addition relative to continental loss, and hence increased continental crust growth rate, occur at {\~{}}1.7-1.2Ga, {\~{}}0.85-0.75Ga, and {\~{}}0.45-0.35Ga, and follow the formation of the Columbia (Nuna), Rodinia and Gondwana supercontinents respectively. Distinct increases in continental loss compared to continental addition, i.e. decreased continental growth rate, occur at {\~{}}1.0-0.9Ga, and {\~{}}0.6-0.55Ga, correlating with the periods of Rodinia and Gondwana amalgamation respectively. Formation of Pangea by introversion rather than extroversion, means that continental addition in exterior orogens was concurrent with continental loss in interior orogens; a similar process may have been responsible for formation of the Columbia supercontinent. Peaks in the compilation of U-Pb zircon ages correlate with the timing of supercontinent amalgamation, and are likely to be a consequence of preferential preservation of continental crust during this part of the supercontinent cycle. ?? 2011 International Association for Gondwana Research.},

  abstract     = {The Antarctic Ross Orogen was built up during the early Paleozoic in the framework of the convergence between the Paleo-Pacific oceanic plate and the Gondwana continental margin. Models for the Ross Orogen in northern Victoria Land are based on terranes having a variable provenance with respect to the margin. However, recent studies provide evidence for the occurrence of different pieces of the lithospheric puzzle: (i) the Wilson continental magmatic arc, representing the main part of the active Gondwana margin, (ii) the Bowers arc-backarc system, (iii) the Admiralty crustal ribbon including continental material of the Wilson forearc, and (iv) the newly discovered, Cambrian oceanic magmatic Tiger arc, along the Ross Sea coast. An updated model is presented in which, after the Early Cambrian magmatic activity of the Wilson arc, a retreat of the subduction zone in the Early-Middle Cambrian gave way to boudinage of the Wilson forearc, trenchward arc migration, opening of the Bowers backarc basin and inception of the outboard Tiger subduction zone. Renewed convergence resulted in the development of the Middle Cambrian Bowers arc, closure of the backarc and deep underthrusting of portions of it at the Middle-Late Cambrian. Finally, in the latest Cambrian to earliest Ordovician, fast exhumation was coupled in the north with erosion and sediment shed to the northeast, and with extension and potassic magmatism in central and southern Victoria Land. ?? 2010 International Association for Gondwana Research.},

  abstract     = {The late Jurassic-early Cretaceous is commonly considered the only cold climatic interval in Earth history without any direct evidence of polar ice. A newly discovered dropstone-bearing interval from the subtropical Iberian Basin (western Tethys) is described and provides evidence of contemporaneous polar glaciation. This interval is correlated laterally for 4.8 km and contains a boulder and two cobble-sized quartzite dropstones that are encased in mid-Cretaceous fissile black shales and fine-grained sandstones. Based on previously published dimensions of similar large clasts, only glacial dropstones and impact ejecta blocks reach the dimensions of the boulder-sized dropstone reported from Iberia. The dropstones show morphological features compatible with glacial transport and abrasion in a subglacial setting which closely resembles the features observed in recent glacial boulders exposed near the snouts of glaciers in Iceland. These Late Aptian dropstones from Spain correlate with many other similar erratics in the northern and southern palaeohemispheres, and suggest that ice sheets formed around the palaeo-North Pole during certain periods of the early Cretaceous. Our results and associated evidence such as the occurrence of glendonites, tillites, moderate- to high-amplitude sea-level oscillations worldwide, minimum pCO2 concentrations, variation in calcareous nannofossil assemblages from low and high latitudes and isotopic excursions suggest that during the mid-Cretaceous there were periods of ice growth and decay that influenced the palaeotemperature, palaeoecology and sedimentology of the marine realm. The new data from Iberia are supported by recent results from Arctic Canada that indicate cool shelves and a mid-Cretaceous cold snap that developed for {\~{}}6 Myr between 118 and 112 Ma. The late Aptian dropstones reported in eastern Iberia were likely transported from high northern latitudes towards subtropical ones in the western Tethys by an extreme iceberg drift similar to those occurring at the present day in the Atlantic Ocean. Icebergs released from a northern fringing ice sheet may have travelled southwards through the Greenland-Norwegian Seaway.},

Southern Ocean records of ice-rafted debris suggest a significant contribution to the sea level changes from melt water of Antarctic origin, in addition to likely contributions from northern ice sheets, but the relative volumes of melt water from northern and southern sources have yet to be established. Here we simulate the first-order impact of a range of relative meltwater releases from the two polar regions on the distribution of marine oxygen isotopes, using an intermediate complexity model. By comparing our simulations with oxygen isotope data from sediment cores, we infer that the contributions from Antarctica and the northern ice sheets to the documented sea level rises between 65,000 and 35,000 years ago were approximately equal, each accounting for a rise of about 15 m. The reductions in Antarctic ice volume implied by our analysis are comparable to that inferred previously for the Antarctic contribution to meltwater pulse 1A (refs 16, 17), which occurred about 14,200 years ago, during the last deglaciation.},

Temperature records derived from central Greenland ice cores show one significant temperature anomaly between 8,200 and 8,100 years ago, which is often attributed to a meltwater outflow into the North Atlantic Ocean and a slowdown of North Atlantic Deep Water formation--this anomaly provides an opportunity to study such processes with relevance to present-day freshening of the North Atlantic. Anomalies in climate proxy records from locations around the globe are often correlated with this sharp event in Greenland. But the anomalies in many of these records span 400 to 600 years, start from about 8,600 years ago and form part of a repeating pattern within the Holocene. More sudden climate changes around 8,200 years ago appear superimposed on this longer-term cooling. The compounded nature of the signals implies that far-field climate anomalies around 8,200 years ago cannot be used in a straightforward manner to assess the impact of a slowdown of North Atlantic Deep Water formation, and the geographical extent of the rapid cooling event 8,200 years ago remains to be determined.},

We discuss their respective strengths and weaknesses, as well as progress in the resolution of other physical parameters, such as anisotropy, anelasticity, density, and bulk sound velocity using tomographic approaches. We present the view that future improvements in global seismic tomography require the utilization of the rich information contained in complete broadband seismic waveforms. This is presently within our reach owing to theoretical progress as well as the increase in computational power in recent years.},

  abstract      = {We propose a cheat sensitive quantum protocol to perform a private search on a classical database which is efficient in terms of communication complexity. It allows a user to retrieve an item from the server in possession of the database without revealing which item she retrieved: if the server tries to obtain information on the query, the person querying the database can find it out. Furthermore our protocol ensures perfect data privacy of the database, i.e. the information that the user can retrieve in a single queries is bounded and does not depend on the size of the database. With respect to the known (quantum and classical) strategies for private information retrieval, our protocol displays an exponential reduction both in communication complexity and in running-time computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {The radial seismic normal mode 0S0 was strongly excited by the 2004 Mw = 9.3 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake at a period of 20.5 min. In a spherically symmetric Earth model, 0S0 amplitude is the same everywhere on the Earth's surface. However, when the ellipticity and rotation of the Earth are taken into consideration, theoretical computations predict an amplitude of 0S0 1{\%} higher at the pole than at the equator. Based on a realistic three-dimensional heterogeneous rotating elliptic Earth model, our predictions indicate that the amplitude of 0S0 is 2$\backslash${\%} higher at the pole than at the equator. A longitude dependency of 0S0 amplitude is also shown. The analysis of 13 superconducting gravimeter (SG) records of the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake supports the predicted geographical variations of 0S0 amplitude. We have also obtained new estimates for the frequency and Q of 0S0: 0.8146566$\pm$1.6 10-6 mHz and 5506$\pm$19.

  abstract     = {The Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains are regarded as a key nucleation site for the Antarctic Ice Sheet and they retain a unique long-term record of pre-glacial and early glacial landscape evolution. Here, we use a range of morphometric analyses to constrain the nature of early glaciation and subsequent ice sheet evolution in the interior of East Antarctica, using a new digital elevation model of the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains, derived from an extensive airborne radar survey. We find that an inherited fluvial landscape confirms the existence of the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains prior to the onset of glaciation at the Eocene-Oligocene climate boundary (ca. 34. Ma). Features characteristic of glaciation, at a range of scales, are evident across the mountains. High elevation alpine valley heads, akin to cirques, identified throughout the mountains, are interpreted as evidence for early phases of glaciation in East Antarctica. The equilibrium line altitudes associated with these features, combined with information from fossil plant assemblages, suggest that they formed at, or prior to, 34. Ma. It cannot be ruled out that they may have been eroded by ephemeral ice between the Late Cretaceous and the Eocene (100-34. Ma). Hanging valleys, overdeepenings, truncated spurs and steep-sided, linear valley networks are indicative of a more widespread alpine glaciation in this region. These features represent ice growth at, or before, 33.7. Ma and provide a minimum estimate for the scale of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet between ca. 34 and 14. Ma, when dynamic fluctuations in ice extent are recorded at the coast of Antarctica. The implications are that the early East Antarctic Ice Sheet grew rapidly and developed a cold-based core that preserved the alpine landscape. The patterns of landscape evolution identified provide the earliest evidence for the development of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and can be used to test coupled ice-climate evolution models. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

  abstract     = {Iterative learning control (ILC) is a very effective technique to reduce systematic errors that occur in systems that repetitively perform the same motion or operation. However, several characteristics have prevented standard ILC from being widely used for high precision motion systems. Most importantly, the learned feedforward signal depends on the motion profile (setpoint trajectory) and if this is altered, the learning process has to be repeated. Secondly, ILC amplifies non-repetitive disturbances and noise. Finally, its performance may be limited due to position-dependent dynamics. This paper presents the design and implementation of a time--frequency adaptive ILC that is applicable for motion systems which executes the same motion or operation. It employs the same control system block diagram as standard ILC, but instead of a fixed robustness filter it uses a time-varying filter. By using the results of the time--frequency adaptive ILC, i.e., the shape of the learned feedforward signal, a {\textquotedblleft}piecewise ILC{\textquotedblright} is proposed that leads to the design of a single learned feedforward signal suitable for different setpoints. The results are experimentally shown to work for a high precision motion system.},

Boundaries within or at the base of this surficial layer (e.g. watertable, bedrock surface, transition to unweathered rock) are commonly associated with a strong seismic contrast. Layers contained between the surface and shallowest boundaries may be efficient waveguides and, as such, associated with significant source-generated seismic noise. Whereas Rayleigh waves (groundroll) can be described in terms of normal modes, we demonstrate that the faster shingled guided waves can be explained in terms of leaking modes. Due to the relatively high Poisson's ratios in the shallow subsurface, guided waves are composed dominantly of multiply reflected P-waves. We compare our results with those obtained using a conventional acoustic waveguide approximation and discuss methods for extracting information from guided waves for geotechnical and environmental applications.},

While the adjacent Basin and Range province and Rio Grande rift province underwent Cenozoic shortening followed by extension, the plateau experienced approximately 2 km of rock uplift without significant internal deformation. Here we propose that warming of the thicker, more iron-depleted Colorado Plateau lithosphere over 35-40 Myr following mid-Cenozoic removal of the Farallon plate from beneath North America is the primary mechanism driving rock uplift. In our model, conductive re-equilibration not only explains the rock uplift of the plateau, but also provides a robust geodynamic interpretation of observed contrasts between the Colorado Plateau margins and the plateau interior. In particular, the model matches the encroachment of Cenozoic magmatism from the margins towards the plateau interior at rates of 3-6 km Myr(-1) and is consistent with lower seismic velocities and more negative Bouguer gravity at the margins than in the plateau interior. We suggest that warming of heterogeneous lithosphere is a powerful mechanism for driving epeirogenic rock uplift of the Colorado Plateau and may be of general importance in plate-interior settings.},

  abstract     = {The South Tasman Rise is a large submarine plateau of continental origin, located south of Tasmania. In the light of satellite-derived gravity data and shipboard swath-bathymetry and magnetic data collected in 1994 in the South Tasman Rise region, this paper re-examines the sea-floor spreading history of the surrounding ocean basins (northeastern Australian-Antarctic Basin and southwestern Tasman Sea). This information is synthesised in seven plate tectonic reconstructions of the South Tasman Rise region from the mid-Cretaceous (95 Ma) to the Early Oligocene (34 Ma). Our interpretation and model confirm that the South Tasman Rise is composed of two distinct terranes. A western domain, limited to the west by a transform margin along the Tasman Fracture Zone and to the east by a N170 degrees E oriented boundary at 146.5 degrees E, was initially attached to Antarctica. The western terrane rifted away from Antarctica in the Late Paleocene/Early Eocene and underwent severe wrench deformation as the Antarctic plate moved southward relative to the Australian plate. Shear motion continued to shape the Tasman Fracture Zone transform margin until the Early Miocene (chron 6B, 23 Ma) after which the Southeast Indian Ridge axis cleared from the western edge of the South Tasman Rise. An eastern domain limited to the east by a boundary at 146.5 degrees E, rifted off from Tasmania and the East Tasman Plateau. After an initial phase of stretching between Tasmania, the East Tasman Plateau and the Lord Howe Rise that lasted until the mid-Cretaceous, sea-floor spreading in the Tasman Sea started in the Late Cretaceous (chron 3-4y) north of the East Tasman Plateau. Seismic, magnetic and gravity profiles between the eastern South Tasman Rise and the East Tasman Plateau suggest that sea-floor spreading began between the two microcontinental blocks in the Late Cretaceous (ca chron 33y) and failed shortly after (chron 30y).},

Good knowledge of the geomorphological setting and the related process activity in the catchment is important in studies using lacustrine sediments as environmental archives.The survey reveals a small--scale geomorphology dominated by a number of different periglacial upfreezing forms together with bedrock--controlled slope processes. Three different geographically separated geomorphological assemblages were recognised with few sediment transportation pathways connecting them. Composition of substrate, soil water content and vegetation cover combined with different slope angles are probably the most important factors controlling the distribution of the geomorphological features.},

More rigorous constraints on crust composition cannot be had from heat flow data until the relative contributions to surface heat flow from crust and mantle are better determined and the non-orogenic component of heat flow in the areally extensive Phanerozoic regions (35{\%} of the continents) is determined.

                        2O, or 0.019 ??W/m
                        3) we find that the only geotherms that pass through the xenolith P-T data array are those corresponding to crust having very low heat production ({\textless}0.9 wt{\%} K
                        2O). If the lithospheric mantle heat production is higher than our preferred values, the continental crust must have correspondingly lower heat production (i.e., bulk crustal K, Th and U contents lower than that of average Archean granulite facies terrains), which we consider unlikely. If the xenolith P-T data reflect equilibration to a conductive geotherm, then Archean lithosphere is relatively thin (150-200 km, based on intersection of the P-T array with the mantle adiabat) and the primary reason for the lower surface heat flow in Archean regions is decreased crustal heat production, rather than the insulating effects of thick lithsopheric roots. On the other hand, if the xenolith P-T points result from frozen-in mineral equilibria or reflect perturbed geotherms associated with magmatism, then the Archean crust can have higher heat producing element concentrations, lithospheric thickness can range to greater depths and the low surface heat flow in Archean cratons may be due to the insulating effects of thick lithospheric roots. An uppermost limit for Archean crustal heat production of 0.77 ??W/m
                        3 is determined from the heat flow systematics.},

  abstract     = {Aim The paper addresses the classical question of possible plant survival in Iceland during the last glacial period in the light of a palaeobotanical record from northern Iceland, spanning the period 11,300-9000 BP, including the Younger Dryas stadial. We review the Late Cenozoic fossil plant record, the past debate on glacial plant refugia in Iceland, and the evidence for ice-free areas during the Weichselian. Location The investigated lake sediment record comes from Lake Torfadalsvatn, which is situated in the northwestern part of the Skagi peninsula in northern Iceland. Methods The sediment chronology was constructed from the occurrence of the Vedde Ash and the Saksunarvatn ash, two well-dated Icelandic tephras, together with the results from five AMS and conventional radiocarbon dates performed on bulk sediment samples. The vegetational reconstruction was based on detailed pollen analysis of the sediment sequence. Results The pollen analysis revealed that many of the taxa present in the area prior to the Younger Dryas stadial continued to produce pollen during that cold event. The more or less immediate reappearance of a few other pollen taxa at the Younger Dryas-Preboreal boundary suggests that these plants also survived, even if they did not produce sufficient pollen to be recorded during the Younger Dryas stadial. Main conclusions We conclude that the relatively high plant diversity found in high Arctic areas and present-day nunataks in Iceland and Greenland, together with the fact that many plant species were able to survive the Younger Dryas stadial on the Skagi peninsula, suggest that species with high tolerance for climate fluctuations also survived the whole Weichselian in Iceland. This conclusion is supported by recent palaeoclimatic data from ice-cores and deep-sea sediments, indicating that Icelandic climate during the last glacial was only occasionally slightly colder than during the Younger Dryas stadial.},

  abstract     = {Velocity behaviour in chalks is determined by a combination of their depositional conditions and subsequent diagenesis. Based on rock physics data from three drill sites on the Ontong Java Plateau, a strategy for velocity modelling is proposed where geological information is imposed via pore structure models. The Reuss and time-average relations define upper and lower bounds of the velocity data and the self-consistent approximation was applied to find direct links between velocity and changes in microstructure. The latter approach provides an estimate of the dynamic changes of the pore structure as a result of diagenesis in chalks. Depositional pore-models of chalks were determined from environmental conditions and can be defined from textural information. Mechanical compaction and cementation decrease porosity as a function of depth, but may increase the velocity by different rates as the pore structure changes differently. Discrimination between sediment stiffness and pore structure stiffness enables us to justify low velocity for indurated sediments and high velocity for soft sediments. Our results indicate the relevance of the pore structure to velocity interpretation because some variations in velocity data may result from pore structure differences rather than changes in fluid or porosity.},

  abstract     = {We have developed a technique for measuring paleoelevation on the basis of the vesicularity of basaltic lava flows. We are currently applying this technique to determine the timing and extent of Cenozoic uplift of the Colorado Plateau. Because the technique measures paleoatmospheric pressure, it is not subject to uncertainties stemming from the use of proxies that depend on environmental factors other than elevation alone. Vesicular lavas preserve a record of paleopressure at the time and place of lava emplacement because the difference in internal pressure in bubbles at the base and top of a lava flow depends on atmospheric pressure and lava flow thickness. The modal size of the vesicle (bubble) population is larger at the top than at the bottom. This leads directly to paleoatmospheric pressure and thus elevation because the thickness of the flow can easily be measured in the field, and the vesicle sizes can be measured in the laboratory. On the Colorado Plateau, volcanic fields are generally found around the margins of the plateau. Basaltic lavas range in age from 0 to 23 Ma; present elevations range from 1.7 km to 3.3 km. Samples were collected from lava flows in the areas of Marysvale, Springerville, Grand Mesa, and the San Juan Mountains and analyzed to determine the timing and extent of uplift. The analysis of the samples using X-ray computed tomography imaging and our numerical techniques for determining vesicle population statistics indicate uplift of 350-2200 m, depending on age. There is a clear relationship between age and amount of uplift (original elevation subtracted from present elevation). The results indicate slow uplift of similar to40 m/m.y. between 25 Ma and 5 Ma, (only 800 m of uplift during that time), and rapid uplift of 220 m/m.y. since 5 Ma (1100 m during that time). These results reconcile the long-standing controversy between interpretations of ancient versus recent uplift by providing an uplift history curve for the Colorado Plateau.},

During most of the Holocene, the glaciers in Bockfjorden were less extensive than they are today. Their maximum Holocene extension occurred during the Little Ice Age. The initial shoreline emergence after the deglaciation was rapid, and former shorelines younger than 8.5 Ky are below the present sea level. A mid-Holocene transgression of the sea is traced as well as a transgression during the last thousand years.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new derivative-free search method for finding models of acceptable data fit in a multidimensional parameter space. It falls into the same class of method as simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, which are commonly used for global optimization problems. The objective here is to find an ensemble of models that preferentially sample the good data-fitting regions of parameter space, rather than seeking a single optimal model. (A related paper deals with the quantitative appraisal of the ensemble.) The new search algorithm makes use of the geometrical constructs known as Voronoi cells to derive the search in parameter space. These are nearest neighbour regions defined under a suitable distance norm. The algorithm is conceptually simple, requires just two tuning parameters', and makes use of only the rank of a data fit criterion rather than the numerical value. In this way all difficulties associated with the scaling of a data misfit function are avoided, and any combination of data fit criteria can be used. It is also shown how Voronoi cells can be used to enhance any existing direct search algorithm, by intermittently replacing the forward modelling calculations with nearest neighbour calculations. The new direct search algorithm is illustrated with an application to a synthetic problem involving the inversion of receiver functions for crustal seismic structure. This is known to be a non-linear problem, where linearized inversion techniques suffer from a strong dependence on the starting solution. It is shown that the new algorithm produces a sophisticated type of self-adaptive' search behaviour, which to our knowledge has not been demonstrated in any previous technique of this kind.},

Planktic foraminifera counts reveal a very early Holocene thermal optimum 10.7-7.7 kyr BP, with summer sea surface temperatures (SST) of 8degreesC and a much enhanced West Spitsbergen Current. There was a short cooling between 8.8 and 8.2 kyr BP. In the middle and late Holocene summer, SST dropped to 2.5degrees-5.0degreesC, indicative of reduced Atlantic heat advection, except for two short warmings near 2.2 and 1.6 kyr BP. Distinct quasi-periodic spikes of coarse sediment fraction (with large portions of lithic grains, benthic and planktic foraminifera) record cascades of cold, dense winter water down the continental slope as a result of enhanced seasonal sea ice formation and storminess on the Barents shelf over the entire Holocene. The spikes primarily cluster near recurrence intervals of 400-650 and 1000-1350 years, when traced over the entire Holocene, but follow significant 885-/840- and 505-/605-year periodicities in the early Holocene. These non-stationary periodicities mimic the Greenland-Be-10 variability, which is a tracer of solar forcing. Further significant Holocene periodicities of 230, (145) and 93 years come close to the deVries and Gleissberg solar cycles.},

Satellite gravimetry estimates of the AIS mass balance are strongly influenced by mass movement in the Earth inte-rior caused by ice advance and retreat during the last glacial cycle. Here, we develop an improved glacial-isostatic ad-justment (GIA) estimate for Antarctica using newly avail-able GPS uplift rates, allowing us to more accurately sepa-rate GIA-induced trends in the GRACE gravity fields from those caused by current imbalances of the AIS. Our re-vised GIA estimate is considerably lower than previous predictions, yielding an estimate of apparent mass change of 53 $\pm$ 18 Gt yr 1 . Therefore, our AIS mass balance of 114 $\pm$ 23 Gt yr 1 is less negative than previous GRACE es-timates. The northern Antarctic Peninsula and the Amundsen Sea sector exhibit the largest mass loss (26 $\pm$ 3 Gt yr 1 and 127 $\pm$ 7 Gt yr 1 , respectively). In contrast, East Antarctica exhibits a slightly positive mass balance (26 $\pm$ 13 Gt yr 1), which is, however, mostly the consequence of compensat-ing mass anomalies in Dronning Maud and Enderby Land (positive) and Wilkes and George V Land (negative) due to interannual accumulation variations. In total, 6 {\%} of the area constitutes about half the AIS imbalance, contributing 151 $\pm$ 7 Gt yr 1 (ca. 0.4 mm yr 1) to global mean sea-level change. Most of this imbalance is caused by ice-dynamic speed-up expected to prevail in the near future.},

  abstract     = {We have analysed the Ny-{\AA}lesund very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) data over the period 1994 August to 2004 May, and we obtain secular displacement rates relative to a NNR-NUVEL-1A reference frame of 0.2 $\pm$ 0.5 mm yr$-$1, $-$1.7 $\pm$ 0.5 mm yr$-$1 and 4.8 $\pm$ 1.1 mm yr$-$1 for the north, east and vertical directions, respectively. The corresponding global positioning system (GPS) station displacement rates relative to the same reference frame for the north, east, and vertical directions are 0.2 $\pm$ 0.6 mm yr$-$1, $-$2.3 $\pm$ 0.6 mm yr$-$1, and 6.4 $\pm$ 1.5 mm yr$-$1 at NYA1 and -$-$0.1 $\pm$ 0.5 mm yr$-$1, $-$1.6 $\pm$ 0.5 mm yr$-$1, and 6.9 $\pm$ 0.9 mm yr$-$1 at NALL, where these GPS rates were derived from the ITRF2000 velocity solution of Heflin. From the comparison at 25 globally distributed collocated sites, we found that the difference in uplift rate between VLBI and GPS at Ny-{\AA}lesund is mainly due to a GPS reference frame scale rate error corresponding to 1.6 mm yr$-$1 in the GPS vertical rates. The uplift rate was estimated to be 5.2 $\pm$ 0.3 mm yr$-$1 from the analysis of the tide gauge data at Ny-{\AA}lesund. Hence the uplift rates obtained from three different kinds of data are very consistent each other. The absolute gravity (AG) measurements at Ny-{\AA}lesund, which were carried out four times (period: 1998--2002) by three different FG5 absolute gravimeters, lead to a decreasing secular rate of $-$2.5 $\pm$ 0.9{~}$\mu$Gal yr$-$1 (1 $\mu$Gal = 10$-$8 m s$-$2). In this analysis, the actual data obtained from a superconducting gravimeter at Ny-{\AA}lesund were used in the corrections for the gravity tide (including the ocean tide effect) and for the air pressure effect. We have estimated three geophysical contributions to examine the observed rates: (1) the effect of the sea-level (SL) change on a timescale of a few decades, (2) the effect of the present-day ice melting (PDIM) in Svalbard and (3) the sensitivity of the computed post-glacial rebound (PGR) effects to different choices of the models of past ice history and Earth's viscosity parameters. Our analysis indicates that the effect of SL change can be neglected as the main source of the discrepancy. On the other hand, the effect of PDIM cannot be ignored in explaining the mutual relation between the observed horizontal and vertical rates and the predicted ones. A large melting rate of the order of $-$75 cm yr11 (i.e. roughly 1.6 times larger than the mean rate derived from glaciology over Svalbard) would explain the observed uplift but only half of the gravity changes. Our comparison results clearly point out the importance of both the estimation accuracy of the elastic deformations and better observation accuracy to constrain the size of PGR effects in the northwestern Svalbard more tightly.},

  abstract     = {The NW-SE-striking Northeast German Basin (NEGB) forms part of the Southern Permian Basin and contains up to 8 km of Permian to Cenozoic deposits. During its polyphase evolution, mobilization of the Zechstein salt layer resulted in a complex structural configuration with thin-skinned deformation in the basin and thick-skinned deformation at the basin margins. We investigated the role of salt as a decoupling horizon between its substratum and its cover during the Mesozoic deformation by integration of 3D structural modelling, backstripping and seismic interpretation. Our results suggest that periods of Mesozoic salt movement correlate temporally with changes of the regional stress field structures. Post-depositional salt mobilisation was weakest in the area of highest initial salt thickness and thickest overburden. This also indicates that regional tectonics is responsible for the initiation of salt movements rather than stratigraphic density inversion. Salt movement mainly took place in post-Muschelkalk times. The onset of salt diapirism with the formation of N-Soriented rim synclines in Late Triassic was synchronous with the development of the NNE-SSW-striking Rheinsberg Trough due to regional E-W extension. In the Middle and Late Jurassic, uplift affected the northern part of the basin and may have induced south-directed gravity gliding in the salt layer. In the southern part, deposition continued in the Early Cretaceous. However, rotation of salt rim synclines axes to NW-SE as well as accelerated rim syncline subsidence near the NW-SEstriking Gardelegen Fault at the southern basin margin indicates a change from E-Wextension to a tectonic regime favoring the activation of NW-SE-oriented structural elements. During the Late Cretaceous-Earliest Cenozoic, diapirism was associated with regional N-S compression and progressed further north and west. The Mesozoic interval was folded with the formation of WNW-trending salt-cored anticlines parallel to inversion structures and to differentially uplifted blocks. Late Cretaceous-Early Cenozoic compression caused partial inversion of older rim synclines and reverse reactivation of some Late Triassic to Jurassic normal faults in the salt cover. Subsequent uplift and erosion affected the pre-Cenozoic layers in the entire basin. In the Cenozoic, a last phase of salt tectonic deformation was associated with regional subsidence of the basin. Diapirism of the maturest pre-Cenozoic salt structures continued with some Cenozoic rim synclines overstepping older structures. The difference between the structural wavelength of the tighter folded Mesozoic interval and the wider Cenozoic structures indicates different tectonic regimes in Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic. We suggest that horizontal strain propagation in the brittle salt cover was accommodated by viscous flow in the decoupling salt layer and thus salt motion passively balanced Late Triassic extension as well as parts of Late Cretaceous-Early Tertiary compression. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract     = {Major and trace elements, minerals, and grain-size were analysed from the early to mid-Holocene (12 to 4 ky BP) period of a sediment core from the Alpine lake Oberer Landschitzsee (ObLAN, 2076 m a.s.l.), which is located on predominantly crystalline bedrock on the southern slopes of the Austrian Central Alps. Geochemistry and mineralogy were compared with diatom-inferred (Di-) 'date of autumn mixing' (A(mix)), DOC, pH, and selected indicator pollen species from the same sediment core. Principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a positive correlation between processes triggered by temperature and precipitation (e.g., lake mixing, DOC). PCA grouped indicators of physical weathering and enhanced catchment run-off (sand, quartz, feldspar), elements of weathering (e.g., Ti, Rb, Mn) under dryer conditions (clay to silt fractions), and elements that probably were related to changes in redox conditions (Cu, Fe, S, Zn). The duration and height of the snow-pack played an important role in this high-alpine environment, affecting weathering, erosion, pH, and lake stratification. Low Alnus viridis pollen abundance, together with markers for increased elements of erosion, indicated extensive snow-pack. Changes in S coupled with As, and elements indicating increased weathering, reflected climate oscillations. LOI was affected by productivity and erosion. High (late) Di-A(mix) coupled with increased Di-DOC indicated prolonged summers with increased productivity. Cold and wet (snow-rich) phases and subsequent melting caused low pH and a decoupling of the significant linear correlation between sedimentary Ca and Di-pH. Weathering and leaching during climate deteriorations opposed the long-term trend in a loss of cations and forced in-lake alkalinity generation during the following lake warming. Overall, the multi-proxy study indicated complex climate-driven processes within different time-scales (long-term trends, climate oscillations, seasonality). The climate oscillations within 12-5 ky BP corresponded well with the cool and wet phases known from central Europe suggesting a dominant common Atlantic climate impact. When Mediterranean climate established between 5 and 4 ky BP, its influence on the southern slopes of the Alps increased},

Two simulations, one present-day and one glacial, tuned to have similar rates of North Atlantic Deep Water formation are used. Insulation from air-sea gas exchange due to more extended sea ice cover increases Southern Ocean radiocarbon ages by more than 100 yr. Higher rates of sea ice formation and export from high southern latitudes lead to a salinification of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), making it the most saline deep water mass of the glacial world oceans. This increases the density of AABW and hence its rate of formation. Mass and radiocarbon fluxes to the deep ocean are thus decoupled. Both older Southern Ocean waters and a stronger flux of AABW increase radiocarbon ages of glacial bottom waters by up to 300 yr. Available reconstructions of glacial bottom water properties are broadly consistent with the simulation. These results question previous inferences from radiocarbon distributions on glacial deep water formation rates. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {Current interpretations of seismic observations typically argue for significant chemical heterogeneity being present in the two large low shear velocity provinces under Africa and the Pacific. Recently, however, it has been suggested that large lateral temperature variations in the lowermost mantle resulting from a strong thermal gradient across D? may provide an alternative explanation. In case of a high heat flux from the core into the mantle, the magnitude of shear wave velocity variations in tomographic models can be reconciled with isochemical whole mantle flow and a pyrolite composition. So far, the hypothesis of strong core heating has been tested in a consistent manner only against tomographic S-wave velocity models, but not against P-wave velocity models. Here, we explore a new approach to assess geodynamic models and test the assumption of isochemical whole mantle flow with strong core heating directly against the statistics of observed traveltime variations of both P and S waves. Using a spectral element method, we simulate 3-D global wave propagation for periods down to 10 s in synthetic 3-D elastic structures derived from a geodynamic model. Seismic heterogeneity is predicted by converting the temperature field of a high-resolution mantle circulation model (MCM) into seismic velocities using thermodynamic models of mantle mineralogy. Being based on forward modelling only, this approach avoids the problems of limited resolution and non-uniqueness inherent in tomographic inversions while taking all possible finite-frequency effects into account. Capturing the correct physics of wave propagation allows for a consistent test of the assumption of high core heat flow against seismic data. The statistics of long-period body wave traveltime observations show a markedly different behaviour for P and S waves: the standard deviation of P-wave delay times stays almost constant with turning depth, whereas that of the S-wave delay times increases strongly throughout the mantle. Surprisingly, synthetic traveltime variations computed for the isochemical MCM reproduce these different trends. This is not expected from a ray-theoretical point of view and highlights the importance of finite-frequency effects. Most importantly, the large lateral temperature variations in the lower mantle related to strong core heating are able to explain most of the standard deviation of observed P- and S-wave delay times. This is a strong indication that seismic heterogeneity in the lower mantle is likely dominated by thermal variations on the length scales relevant for long-period body waves.},

  year      = {1980},
  abstract  = {Simple thermal models based on the creation and cooling of the lithosphere can account for the observed subsidence of the ocean floor and the measured decreased in heat flow with age. In well-sedimented areas, where there is little loss of heat due to hydrothermal circulation, the surface heat flow decays uniformly from values in excess of 6 $\mu$cal/cm\textsuperscript{2} s (250 mW/m\textsuperscript{2}), for crust younger than 4 Ma (4 m.y. B.P.), to close to 1.1 $\mu$cal/cm\textsuperscript{2} s (46 mW/m\textsuperscript{2}) through crust between 120 and 140 Ma. After 200 Ma the heat flow is predicted to reach an equilibrium value of 0.9 $\mu$cal/cm\textsuperscript{2} s (38 mW/m\textsuperscript{2}). The surface heat flow on continents is controlled by many phenomena. On the time scale of geological periods the most important of these are the last orogenic event, the distribution of heat-producing elements, and erosion. To better understand the effects of age, each continent is separated into four provinces on the basis of radiometric dates. Reflecting the preponderance of Precambrian crust, two of these provinces cover the Archean to the middle Proterozoic, and the third covers the late Proterozoic to the Mesozoic. The mean heat flow decreases from a value of 1.84 $\mu$cal/cm\textsuperscript{2} s (77 mW/m\textsuperscript{2}) for the youngest province to a constant value of 1.1 $\mu$cal/cm\textsuperscript{2} s (46 mW/m\textsuperscript{2}) after 800 Ma. The nonradiogenic component of the surface heat flow decays to a constant value of between 0.65 and 0.5 $\mu$cal/cm\textsuperscript{2} s (25 and 21 mW/m\textsuperscript{2}) within 200--400 Ma. Using theoretical models, we compute the heat loss through the oceans to be 727 $\times$ 1010 cal/s (30.4 $\times$ 1012 W). The comparison between the theoretical and measured values allows an estimate of 241 $\times$ 1010 cal/s (10.1 $\times$ 1012 W) for the heat lost owing to hydrothermal circulation. We show that the heat flow through the marginal basins follows the same relation as that for crust created at a midocean spreading center. These basins have a corresponding heat loss of 71 $\times$ 1010 cal/s (3.0 $\times$ 1012 W). The heat loss through the continents is calculated from the observations and is 208 $\times$ 1010 cal/s (8.8 $\times$ 1012 W). Our estimate of the value for the shelves is 67 $\times$ 1010 cal/s (2.8 $\times$ 1012 W). The total heat loss of the earth is 1002 $\times$ 1010 cal/s (42.0 $\times$ 1012 W), of which 70{\%} is through the deep oceans and marginal basins and 30{\%} through the continents and continental shelves. The creation of lithosphere accounts for just under 90{\%} of the heat lost through the oceans and hence about 60{\%} of the worldwide heat loss. Convective processes, which include plate creation and orogeny on continents, dissipate two thirds of the heat lost by the earth. Conduction through the lithosphere is responsible for 20{\%}, and the rest is lost by the radioactive decay of the continental and oceanic crust. We place bounds of between 0.6 and 0.9 $\mu$cal/cm\textsuperscript{2} s (25 and 38 mW/m\textsuperscript{2}) for the mantle heat flow beneath an ocean at equilibrium and between 0.40 and 0.75 $\mu$cal/cm\textsuperscript{2} s (17 and 31 mW/m\textsuperscript{2}) for the heat flow beneath an old stable continent. The computed range of geotherms for an equilibrium ocean overlaps the range of stable continental geotherms below a depth of 100 km. The mantle heat flow beneath a continent decays with a thermal time constant similar to that of the oceanic lithosphere. The continental basins subside with the same time constant. These observations are evidence that there is no detectable difference between the thermal structure of an equilibrium ocean and that of an old continent. Thus the concept of the lithosphere as a combination of a mechanical and a thermal boundary layer can be applied to both oceans and continents. We evaluate the constraints placed on models based on this concept by seismological observations. In the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary we favor these models because they provide a single explanation for the thermal structure of the lithosphere beneath an equilibrium ocean and a stable continent.},

First-generation plumes -- such as the Permo-Carboniferous European-northwest African {\textquotedblleft}EUNWA{\textquotedblright}, and the Jurassic Karoo and Northwest Australia -- and convergent environments (Variscan Orogen, the Pacific and the Tethyan subduction zones, respectively) seem to be genetically associated. This may indicate that mantle plumes tend to be initiated by long-lived downwelling lithospheric slabs causing instabilities at the lower mantle boundary layers. First-generation plumes are larger (diameter ca. 3000 km) than the late-generation plumes (ca. 2000 km) and apparently have a radial dispersion of magmatism and rifting. These plumes ramified spatially and a second generation of plumes, commonly splitting to two offshoots, and even a third generation developed, acting in a similar temporal rhythm (60 m.y. plume activity followed by 20 m.y. of quiescence). The Indian path consists of an exceptionally relatively short-lasting swarm of plumes: Rajmahal-Kerguelen (20 m.y.), Madagascar (8m.y.) and Deccan (7 m.y.), whose migration significantly changed course from the main trend. The recurrent consequential breakup and formation of spreading centers along this path is indicative of migration below the upper mantle circulation. This swarm of plumes may also point to a similar Lower mantle source that was influenced by a northeastward weak flow. Although plume migration is suggested to have taken place in the lower mantle, the expansion of magmatism within igneous provinces is probably due to sub-lithospheric migration of the plume.},

The survey operations were a major challenge due to excessive jet streams at altitude as well as occasional excessive mountain waves.

Two important topsoil variables for precision farming applications, soil organic matter and soil texture, were found to be correlated with spectral properties of the airborne HyMap scanner. The percentage sand, clay, organic carbon and total nitrogen content could be predicted quantitatively and simultaneously by a multivariate calibration approach using either partial least-square regression (PLSR) or multiple linear regression (MLR). The different topsoil parameters are determined simultaneously from the spectral signature contained in the single hyperspectral image, since the various variables were represented by varying combinations of wavebands across the spectra. The methodology proposed provides a means of simultaneously estimating topsoil organic matter and texture in a rapid and non-destructive manner, whilst avoiding the spatial accuracy problems associated with spatial interpolation. The use of high spatial resolution and hyperspectral remotely sensed data in the manner proposed in this paper can also be used to monitor and better understand the influence of management and land use practices on soil organic matter composition and content. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

At three glacier forelands with southerly aspects (Hogsetbreen, Vestre Hoybre and Ostre Hoybre), relatively small (less than or equal to4 m high) discrete boulder moraine ridges are shown to date from the 'Little Ice Age'. The remaining three glaciers ( Ostre Tundradalskyrkjabre, Nordre Tundradalskyrkjabre and Hestdalshogdibreen), with northerly or easterly aspects and large, multiridged, rampart-like moraine complexes (15-30 m), thought to be ice-cored and of the 'push-deformation' type, lie above the local altitudinal limit of permafrost. Negatively skewed R-value distributions from these moraine complexes provide critical evidence for pre-'Little Ice Age' glacier expansion as they indicate the survival of long-weathered boulders on moraine surfaces where late-lying snow may reduce or prevent lichen growth. Formation of the moraine complexes appears to have begun in Preboreal times, most likely during the Erdalen Event, but much of their present character was determined by repeated Neoglacial glacier expansion, moraine deformation and ridge formation in the late Holocene, culminating in the 'Little Ice Age' readvance.},

  abstract     = {Under the prevailing turbidite paradigm, the term 'turbidite' (i.e., deposits of turbidity currents with Newtonian rheology and turbulent state) is used very loosely and is commonly applied to deposits of debris flows with plastic rheology and laminar state. For example, because 'high-density turbidity currents' are defined on the basis of three different concepts (i.e., how density, grain size, and driving force), there are no consistent criteria for recognition of their deposits. As a result, deep-water massive sands of debris-flow origin are routinely misinterpreted as high-density turbidites. The concept of waxing flow as a type of turbidity current is problematic because waxing flows are defined on the basis of velocity, not on fluid rheology and flow state. The waxing-flow concept allows inversely graded sands to be misinterpreted as turbidites. Perhaps, the most problematic issue is the use of alluvial channel traction bed forms observed in flume experiments as the analog for the five divisions of the Bouma Sequence (i.e., classic turbidites deposited from suspension). This is because flume experiments were conducted under equilibrium flow conditions, whereas natural turbidity currents deposit sediment under disequilibrium waning flow conditions. This and other problems of deep-water processes and facies models are addressed in this paper from the author's personal perspective. Classification of sediment-gravity flows into Newtonian flows (e.g., turbidity currents) and plastic flows (e.g., debris flows), based on fluid rheology and flow state, is a meaningful and practical approach. Although popular deep-water facies models are based on transport mechanisms, there are no standard criteria in the depositional record to reliably interpret transport mechanisms. According to existing turbidite-facies models, an ideal turbidite bed, which has normal grading, with gravel- to mud-size particles should contain a total of 16 divisions. However, no one has ever documented a complete turbidite bed with 16 divisions in modern or ancient deposits. Recognition of units deposited by deep-water bottom currents (also referred to as contour currents) is difficult. Traction structures are good indicators of bottom-current reworking, but distinguishing deposits of bottom currents from deposits of overbanking turbidity currents is difficult even though it has important implications for developing depositional models for hydrocarbon exploration and production. I consider sandy debris flows to be the dominant process responsible for transporting and depositing sands in the deep sea. Experiments on sandy debris flows suggest that low clay content (as little as 1{\%}) is sufficient to provide the strength necessary for sandy debris flows. Deposits of experimental sandy debris hows are characterized by massive sand, sharp upper contacts, floating clasts, inverse grading, normal grading with clasts, and water-escape structures. As a counterpart to turbidite-dominated fan models suited for basinal settings, a slope model is proposed that is a debris-Bow dominated setting with both non-channelized and channelized systems. Contrary to popular belief, deposits of sandy debris flows can be thick, areally extensive, clean (i.e., mud poor), and excellent reservoirs. High-frequency flows tend to develop amalgamated debris-flow deposits with lateral connectivity and sheet-like geometry. Submarine-fan models with turbidite channels and lobes have controlled our thinking for nearly 35 years, but I consider that these models are obsolete. The suprafan lobe concept was influential in both sedimentologic and sequeace-stratigraphic circles because it provided a basis for constructing a general fan model and for linking mounded seismic facies with sheet-like turbidite sandstones. However, this concept recently was abandoned by its proponent, which has left the popular sequence-stratigraphic fan models with a shaky foundation. A paradigm shift is in order in the 21\textsuperscript{st} century. This shift should involve the realization that thick deep-water massive sands are deposits of debris flows, not 'high-density turbidites'. However, there are no standard vertical facies models that can be applied universally for either turbidites, contourites, or sandy debris flows. Science is a journey, whereas facies models terminate that journey and become the final destination. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {We present a method that uses a global seismic model of the crust and upper mantle to guide the extrapolation of existing heat-flow measurements to regions where such measurements are rare or absent. For any chosen spatial point on the globe, the procedure generates a histogram of heat-flow values determined from existing measurements obtained from regions that are structurally similar to the target point. The inferred histograms are based on a "structural similarity functional", which is introduced to quantify the structural analogy between different regions. We apply this procedure world-wide using the global heat-flow data base of Pollack et al. [Rev. Geophys. 31 (1993) 267] guided by an update of the 3-D shear velocity model of the crust and uppermost mantle of Shapiro and Ritzwoller [Geophys. J. Int. 51 (2002) 88]. The method results in an inferred probability distribution for the heat flux for each geographical region of interest. These distributions are strongly non-Gaussian, but are well approximated by the log-logistic distribution which is completely specified by two parameters. The inferred distributions agree well with observed distributions of heat flux taken in 300-km radius circles regionally in numerous locations. Particular attention is drawn to the inferred surface heat flux distributions across Antarctica, where direct measurements are rare but information about heat flow may be needed to help understand the dynamics of the Antarctic ice sheets and ice streams. Mean heat flow in West Antarctica is expected to be nearly three times higher than in East Antarctica and much more variable. This high heat flow may affect the dynamics of West Antarctic ice streams and the stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {Multidisciplinary study of a key section on the Laptev Sea Coast (Bykovsky Peninsula, east Lena Delta) in 1998-2001 provides the most complete record of Middle and Late Weichselian environments in the East Siberian Arctic. The 40-m high Mamontovy Khayata cliff is a typical Ice Complex section built of icy silts with a network of large syngenetic polygonal ice wedges, and is richly fossiliferous. In combination with pollen, plant macrofossil and mammal fossils, a sequence of ca 70 insect samples provides a new interpretation of the environment and climate of the area between ca 50 and 12 ka. The large number of radiocarbon dates from the section, together with an extensive 14C database on mammal bones, allows chronological correlation of the various proxies. The Bykovsky record shows how climate change, and the Last Glacial Maximum in particular, affected terrestrial organisms such as insects and large grazing mammals. Both during the presumed "Karginsky Interstadial" (MIS 3) and the Sartanian Glacial (MIS 2), the vegetation remained a mosaic arctic grassland with relatively high diversity of grasses and herbs and dominance of xeric habitats: the tundra-steppe type. This biome was supported by a constantly very continental climate, caused by low sea level and enormous extension of shelf land. Variations within the broad pattern were caused mainly by fluctuations in summer temperature, related to global trends but overprinted by the effect of continentality. No major changes in humidity were observed nor were advances of modern-type forest or forest-tundra recorded, suggesting a major revision of the "Karginsky Interstadial" paradigm. The changing subtypes of the tundra-steppe environment were persistently favourable for mammalian grazers, which inhabited the shelf lowlands throughout the studied period. Mammal population numbers were lowered during the LGM, especially toward its end, and then flourished in a short, but impressive peak in the latest Weichselian, just before the collapse of the tundra-steppe biome. Throughout MIS 3 and MIS 2, the climate remained very favourable for the aggradation of permafrost. No events of regional permafrost degradation were observed in the continuous Bykovsky sequence until the very end of the Pleistocene. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We invert this model and use the high-pass filtered Vostok stable isotope records to make a first, tentative, attempt to estimate high-latitude N. Hemisphere temperature variability over the last four glacial periods, beyond the reach of Greenland ice-core records. The model result is compared against the Vostok methane record, which shows rapid variations in parallel to Greenland temperature records during the last glacial period. A further comparison is carried out against the planktonic oxygen isotope of north Atlantic core ODP 980. There is agreement between the records on the existence of similar millennial-scale variability during the last three glacial periods with very similar characteristics to the variability during the last glacial cycle. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract     = {The land surface of what is now the Barents Sea region may have been eroded to a sub-aerial platform prior to the Quaternary, due to both tectonic uplift-induced and sea-level lowering-induced erosion processes. The Barents Sea was then further eroded into its present form by the subsequent action of ice sheets. Two bedrock configurations, representing the pre-Quaternary sub-aerial Barents Shelf topography and the largely submarine morphology of the present day, were used as input to a glaciological ice sheet model so that the dynamic evolution of the maximum-sized ice sheets, caused solely by a change in bedrock elevation, could be identified. The ice-sheet model was run under constant glacial environmental conditions, until mass balance stability was reached, over both bedrock configurations. The simple parabolic ice sheet surface, which formed on a flat sub-aerial bedrock platform, was found to be significantly different in dynamic character compared with an ice sheet developed on the present submarine bedrock topography. In this latter situation, the central ice dome is drained by ice streams in Bj{\o}rn{\o}yrenna, Storfjordrenna and smaller outlet glaciers in the north of the ice sheet.},

  abstract     = {Geological investigations undertaken through the Quaternary Environments of the Eurasian North programme established ice-sheet limits for the Eurasian Arctic at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), sedimentary records of palaeo-ice streams and uplift information relating to ice-sheet configuration and the pattern of deglaciation. Ice-sheet numerical modelling was used to reconstruct a history of the Eurasian Ice Sheet compatible with these geological datasets. The result was a quantitative assessment of the time-dependent behaviour of the ice sheet, its mass balance and climate, and predictions of glaciological products including sediments, icebergs and meltwater. At the LGM, ice cover was continuous from Scandinavia to the Arctic Ocean margin of the Barents Sea to the north, and the Kara Sea to the east. In the west, along the continental margin between the Norwegian Channel and Svalbard, the ice sheet was characterised by fast flowing ice streams occupying bathymetric troughs, which fed large volumes of sediment to the continental margin that were deposited as a series of trough mouth fans. Ice streams may also have been present in bathymetric troughs to the north between Svalbard and Franz Josef Land. Further east, however, the ice sheet was thinner. Across the Kara Sea, the ice thickness was predicted to be less than 300m, while on Severnaya Zemlya the ice cover may have been thinner at the LGM than at present. It is likely that the Taymyr Peninsula was mainly free of ice at the LGM. In the south, the ice margin was located close to the shoreline of the Russian mainland. The climate associated with this ice sheet is maritime to the west and, in stark contrast, desert-like in the east. Atmospheric General Circulation Modelling has revealed that such a contrast is possible under relatively warm north Atlantic conditions because a circulation system develops across the Kara Sea, isolating it from the moisture-laden westerlies, which are diverted to the south. Ice-sheet decay began through enhanced iceberg calving in the deepest regions of the Barents Sea, which caused a significant ice embayment within the Bear Island Trough. By about 12,000 years ago, further iceberg calving reduced ice extent to the northern archipelagos and their surrounding shallow seas. Ice decay was complete by about 10,000 years ago. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {Antarctic subglacial lakes provide аn important boundary condition for thermal analysis of the ice sheet in that the basal ice temperature over lakes may be assumed to be at the pressure-melting point. We have used a one-dimensional vertical heat-transfer equation to determine theoretical temperature values for the ice-sheet base above 77 subglacial lakes identified from airborne radio-echo-sounding data covering 50% of Antarctica. Variations in our temperature results to below the pressure-melting temperature over lakes are due to either our estimate of the geothermal heat flux or a neglect of heat derived from (a) internal ice deformation and (b) basal sliding, in the thermal model. Our results indicate that, when the geothermal heat flux is set at 54 m W m$-$2, the ice-sheet base above 70% of the known Antarctic subglacial lakes is calculated to be at the pressure-melting value. These lakes are located mainly around Dome C, Ridge B and Vostok station. For the ice sheet above subglacial lakes located hundreds of kilometres from the ice divide, using the same thermal model, loss of heat due to vertical advection is calculated to be relatively high. In such regions, if the ice-sheet base is at the pressure-melting point, heat lost due to vertical advection must be supplemented by heat from other sources. For the three lakes beneath Terre Ad{\'{e}}lie and George V Land, for instance, the basal thermal gradient calculated to produce pressure melting at the ice-sheet base is equivalent to 1.5-2 times the value obtained when 54 m W m$-$2 of geothermal heat is used as the sole basal thermal component. We suggest that, as distance from the ice divide increases, so too does the amount of heat due to internal ice deformation and basal sliding. Moreover, by considering the ice-sheet basal thermal characteristics above subglacial lakes which lie on the same ice flowline, we demonstrate empirically that the heat due to these horizontal ice-motion terms varies pseudo-exponentially with distance from the ice divide. The location along a flowline where a rapid increase in the basal heat gradient is calculated may correspond to the onset of large-scale basal sliding.},

  abstract     = {Recently acquired glacial geological and oceanographic datasets provide information on the Weichselian glaciations of Scandinavia and the Eurasian Arctic. A numerical ice-sheet model, forced by global sea level and solar insolation changes, was run to reconstruct ice sheets compatible with these data. A 'maximum' reconstruction assumes that the modern-type temperature distribution across the Eurasian Arctic is reduced by 10??C at three stages during the Weichselian, which are related to minimum levels of solar insolation. Conversely, a 'minimum' model incorporates a reduction in temperature of only 5??C in Early and Middle Weichselian time. The 'maximum' reconstruction employs the relatively larger sea-level fall suggested by the ??18O deep-sea record, while the 'minimum' run uses the more conservative sea-level estimate from New Guinea coral reef terraces. The maximum model predicts three major glacial advances in the Weichselian. These compare well to geological evidence for ice-sheet growth during the Early, Middle and Late Weichselian. Geological evidence for the Late Weichselian ice sheet is compatible with either reconstruction if ice growth across the Taymyr Peninsula is curtailed. The models show that ice-sheet advance caused by the interaction of sea level and solar insolation changes yields a time-dependent ice volume function similar to that established from the geological record. Periods of seasonally open water within the seas bordering the Eurasian Arctic generally occur prior to glaciation, and may provide a source of precipitation for ice-sheet growth. In contrast, periods of ice-rafted debris deposition and depletion in surface-ocean ??18O in sea-floor sediments compare well with the model's determination of ice-sheet decay and melting. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract     = {Although limits of the Eurasian Ice Sheet at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) are known relatively well from geological evidence, the palaeoclimate coexistent with this ice sheet has yet to be identified confidently. A simple ice-sheet model has been used to determine LGM climate conditions by finding the ice-sheet mass-balance configuration that permits model results to match with geological data relating to the extent of LGM ice cover. These conditions are compared with Atmospheric General Circulation Model (AGCM) calculations of the climate at the LGM, which reveal the meteorological conditions associated with the ice-sheet mass-balance. The western margin of Scandinavia is characterised by a maritime climate, influenced by the nearby warm, seasonally sea-ice free, ocean conditions. However, further east, the warming effect of the North Atlantic diminishes and an extreme polar desert climate dominates across the Kara Sea similar to East Antarctica today. The LGM climate that we establish is in contrast to many previous reconstructions involving snow-laden warm westerly winds originating from the North Atlantic affecting the entire Eurasian Arctic. Severely cold conditions across the Eurasian Arctic are compatible with a stable circulation cell over the Kara Sea that isolates the region climatically, and/or cold dry westerly winds from the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet that flow across the rest of the Eurasian Arctic. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract     = {We present a three-dimensional (3D) SV-wave velocity model of the upper mantle beneath the Antarctic plate constrained by fundamental and higher mode Rayleigh waves recorded at regional distances. The good agreement between our results and previous surface wave studies in the uppermost 200 km of the mantle confirms that despite strong differences in data processing, modern surface wave tomographic techniques allow to produce consistent velocity models, even at regional scale. At greater depths the higher mode information present in our data set allows us to improve the resolution compared to previous regional surface wave studies in Antarctica that were all restricted to the analysis of the fundamental mode. This paper is therefore mostly devoted to the discussion of the deeper part of the model. Our seismic model displays broad domains of anomalously low seismic velocities in the asthenosphere. Moreover, we show that some of these broad, low-velocity regions can be more deeply rooted. The most remarkable new features of our model are vertical low-velocity structures extending from the asthenosphere down to the transition zone beneath the volcanic region of Marie Byrd Land, West Antarctica and a portion of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge close to the Balleny Islands hotspot. A deep low-velocity anomaly may also exist beneath the Ross Sea hotspot. These vertical structures cannot be explained by vertical smearing of shallow seismic anomalies and synthetic tests show that they are compatible with a structure narrower than 200 km which would have been horizontally smoothed by the tomographic inversion. These deep low-velocity anomalies may favor the existence of several distinct mantle plumes, instead of a large single one, as the origin of volcanism in and around West Antarctica. These hypothetical deep plumes could feed large regions of low seismic velocities in the asthenosphere. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {Hotspots include midplate features like Hawaii and on-axis features like Iceland. Mantle plumes are a well-posed hypothesis for their formation. Starting plume heads provide an explanation of brief episodes of flood basalts, mafic intrusions, and radial dike swarms. Yet the essence of the hypothesis hides deep in the mantle. Tests independent of surface geology and geochemistry to date have been at best tantalizing. It is productive to bare the current ignorance, rather than to dump the plume hypothesis. One finds potentially fruitful lines of inquiry using simple dynamics and observations. Ancient lithospheric xenoliths may reveal heating by plumes and subsequent thermal equilibration in the past. The effect at the base of the chemical layer is modest 50-100??K for transient heating by plume heads. Thinning of nonbuoyant platform lithosphere is readily observed but not directly attributable to plumes. The plume history in Antarctica is ill constrained because of poor geological exposure. This locality provides a worst case on what is known about surface evidence of hotspots. Direct detection of plume tail conduits in the mid-mantle is now at the edge of seismic resolution. Seismology does not provide adequate resolution of the deep mantle. We do not know the extent of a chemically dense dregs layer or whether superplume regions are cooler or hotter than an adiabat in equilibrium with the asthenosphere. Overall, mid-mantle seismology is most likely to give definitive results as plume conduits are the guts of the dynamic hypothesis. Finding them would bring unresolved deep and shallow processes into place. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {Detailed mineral magnetic measurements were conducted on a 9000-year varved lake sediment sequence in northern Sweden (Lake Sarsjo {\"{}}n). The results demonstrate that the paramagnetic susceptibility reflects the concentration of detrital minerogenic material in the lake sediments, which is controlled to a large extent by the intensity of the spring snow melt. In contrast, the concentration of ferrimagnetic magnetite (reflected by initial magnetic susceptibility and magnetic hysteresis parameters) is positively correlated to the concentration of organic carbon, which is most likely of an autochthonous origin. This magnetite has magnetic properties that are characteristic of stable single-domain magnetite grains produced by magnetotactic bacteria. The paramagnetic susceptibility record clearly points to a climatic excursion in the early Holocene between 6100 $\pm$ 174 bc and 5700 $\pm$ 167 bc, which can be correlated to an 18O excursion (a cold event) in the Greenland ice cores and lake sediments in southern Germany, and also to a short period of increased glacial activity in Scandinavia. The middle Holocene (4000--1760 bc) is characterized by sediment with a low concentration of detrital minerals and a high organic carbon content, whereas the late Holocene (1760 bc--ad 1918) is marked by more frequent and intense periods of detrital sedimentation.},

  abstract     = {We use a combination of body wave and interface wave observations from an on-bottom seismic refraction survey to constrain the fine-scale seismic structure of the upper crust in a similar to3x3 km field area centered on the East Pacific Rise at 9degrees50'N. We detonated 18 explosive shots (18 sources) in a circular pattern (1.5 km radius) on the rise axis and recorded seismic arrivals with eight ocean bottom seismometers (eight receivers). We observed 30-40 Hz compressional body waves from all shots (144 P waves) and 1-3 Hz Stoneley (interface) waves on a subset of source-receiver pairs (58 interface waves). Using a station correction inversion, we find that roughly half of the variance in the P wave first-arrival times results from lateral variations in the thickness of the surface low-velocity layer (SLVL), a layer of extremely porous lava and basalt breccia with an average P wave velocity of 2.2 km s(-1). The SLVL thickness increases from {\textless}20 m along the axial summit trough (AST) to similar to 120 m at near-axis lava depocenters, which are not symmetric about the rise axis. Depocenters are located similar to 0.5 km to the west and similar to 1.5 km to the east of the rise axis. Tomographic inversion of the Stoneley wave first arrivals reveals that shear velocities in the SLVL covary with the layer thickness, exhibiting a similar asymmetric pattern, with shear velocities increasing from similar to 320 m s(-1) near the AST to similar to 520 m s(-1) at the near-axis depocenters. Our analysis demonstrates that the seismic characteristics of the extrusive layer near the rise axis are related primarily to volcanic features and processes. The thickness and velocity of the SLVL are low on the axis and within channel networks that deliver lava flows away from the axis and then increase rapidly at the distal ends of the channels where the lavas are deposited. We find that azimuthal anisotropy exerts only a weak influence on our P wave first-arrival times, which we model as weak (4{\%}) seismic azimuthal anisotropy in the upper dikes with a fast axis oriented N23 degrees-32 degrees W. We find no evidence for seismic azimuthal anisotropy in the extrusive layer.},

Here we report a reconstruction of the sunspot number covering the past 11,400 years, based on dendrochronologically dated radiocarbon concentrations. We combine physics-based models for each of the processes connecting the radiocarbon concentration with sunspot number. According to our reconstruction, the level of solar activity during the past 70 years is exceptional, and the previous period of equally high activity occurred more than 8,000 years ago. We find that during the past 11,400 years the Sun spent only of the order of 10{\%} of the time at a similarly high level of magnetic activity and almost all of the earlier high-activity periods were shorter than the present episode. Although the rarity of the current episode of high average sunspot numbers may indicate that the Sun has contributed to the unusual climate change during the twentieth century, we point out that solar variability is unlikely to have been the dominant cause of the strong warming during the past three decades.},

Some of the features and their distribution may be closely related to a major glacial surge in 1936-1938, and as such are valuable in identifying former surges in other locations. A continuous, wide ridge with a characteristic asymmetrical cross-section, running subparallel to the glacier, is the end moraine defining the maximum extent of the surge. A large part of the material forming this ridge is most likely rapidly deposited from meltwater during the surge. A rhombohedral pattern of smaller mounds inside the ridge is probably an expression of relief in the glacier sole during the surge. Discontinuous arcuate ridges define local, minor oscillations during retreat of the ice at a later stage. Iceberg plough marks are most frequent seaward of the end moraine, their orientation is controlled by the combination of a coastal current, offshore katabatic winds and topography. Superimposed on plough marks are secondary features such as a "washboard pattern" and striae, most likely caused by push-up of overconsolidated material during gouging and multi-keel icebergs, respectively. Bottom sediments, observed in photographs and cores, are loose, pebbly muds with high variability in clast content, resting on overconsolidated material, probably basal till. Mud deposition presently prevails close to the glacier. ?? 1985.},

  abstract     = {The Lady Franklin Basin, which contains a thick succession of Cretaceous and Cenozoic sediments, constitutes the western part of the southern West Greenland offshore area. In the Davis Strait and Labrador Sea region rifting was initiated in the earliest Cretaceous and a number of basins formed. In time these basins deepened, although subsidence was interrupted by two main phases of uplift and erosion that took place in middle and late Cretaceous time, resulting in two hiatuses in the succession. Sediments with source or reservoir potential were deposited in the basins. Source rocks are known to occur in the marine Cretaceous successions of onshore northern Canada and central West Greenland and also offshore eastern Canada, and can therefore be expected to occur in the Lady Franklin and Maniitsoq basins.  In the Lady Franklin area Paleocene volcanism associated with further tectonism caused the eruption of flood basalts and hyaloclastites on top of the Cretaceous mudstone and sandstone succession. A Lower Palaeogene sediment succession, which may contain both source and reservoir rocks, was then deposited on top of the basalts, as seen in the nearby Canadian Hekja O-71 well. Around the Ypresian to Lutetian transition a regression took place. The regression gave rise to an unconformity and a hiatus spanning a few million years throughout the entire West Greenland shelf. New deposition followed and, after a long period, major compression set in and a regression occurred across the whole shelf in Late Oligocene time. Erosion set in and was deep on the southern shelf, resulting in a hiatus spanning about 39\hspace{0.167em}Ma. To the north the hiatus is only about 19\hspace{0.167em}Ma.  In early Middle Miocene time the tectonic regime in the Davis Strait area changed. Subsidence and deposition resumed offshore West Greenland. These events may have created conditions for generation of hydrocarbons in the potential source-rock sequences in the Cretaceous succession. Therefore, although hydrocarbon exploration has been limited in this region and had little success, it is thought that conditions are favourable for the discovery of significant oil and gas accumulations},

Together with earlier work from the same region this yields a nearly complete record from the time of deglaciation to the present. Isolation and/or transgression sequences in one lake and five tidal basins have been identified using lithostratigraphic analyses, sedimentary characteristics, magnetic susceptibility, saturated induced remanent magnetisation (SIRM), organic and carbonate content, and macrofossil analyses. AMS radiocarbon dating of macrofossils and bulk sediment samples provides the timescale. Relative sea level fell rapidly and reached present-day level at similar to 9300 cal.yr BP and continued falling until at least 9000 cal.yr BP. Between 8000and6000cal.yrBPsea level reached its lowest level of around similar to 10m below highest astronomical tide. At around 5000 cal. yr BP, sea level had reached above 7.8 m below highest astronomical tide and slowly continued to rise, not reaching present-day sea level until today. The isostatic rebound caused rapid isolation of the basins that are seen as distinct isolation contacts in the sediments. In contrast, the late Holocene transgressions are less well defined and occurred over longer time intervals. The late Holocene sea-level rise may be a consequence of isostatic reloading by advancing glaciers and/or an effect of the delayed response to isostatic rebound of the Laurentide ice sheet. One consequence of this transgression is that settlements of Palaeo-Eskimo Cultures may be missing in Southern Greenland. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we present new relative sea-level data from southern Greenland, a key area for understanding the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) response to climate change. Within fourteen lakes and marine lagoons from the inner part of Bredefjord (Nordre Sermilik) in southern Greenland, isolations revealed by stratigraphic and palaeoecological analyses are dated and relative sea levels reconstructed. Due to coastal emergence caused by the GIS retreat within the area, the relative sea-level fell rapidly in the early Holocene between at least c. 9600 and c. 7300 cal yrs BP attaining a rate of 2cm per year between 9600 and 8000 cal yrs BP. Spatial variability in relative sea-level changes is show for southern Greenland from a comparison with the Nanortalik and the Qaqortoq areas. The regression occurred about 2000 years later in the inner Bredefjord area, compared to the Nanortalik area, and about 1000 years later compared to the Qaqortoq area. This is a consequence of earlier deglaciation in areas located at the outer coast. Between c. 8000 cal yrs BP and the present day, relative sea level was lower than today. The lowest relative sea level in the Inner Bredefjord area of between-5.4 and-15m a.h.a.t. (above highest astronomical tide) was reached between 7000 and 1000 cal yrs BP. The neoglacial readvance together with the collapse of the Laurentide peripheral bulge is probably responsible for the transgression in the Inner Bredefjord area, as has been indicated from the nearby sites Qaqortoq and Nanortalik. Our relative sea-level reconstructions showing spatial variability within southern Greenland have implications for Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) modelling and the understanding of the GIS ice sheet dynamics. The early Holocene regression is consistent with the recession of the southern sector of the GIS from the shelf edge at c. 22000 cal yrs BP, reaching inland of the present day outer coast by c. 12000 cal yrs BP, and its present margin by c. 10500 cal yrs BP. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract     = {Offshore exploration in Norway and Denmark---in the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea---has involved drilling about 850 wildcat wells, resulting in about 300 oil and gas finds, of which 84 are fields with production. The recoverable resources of all these finds  total about 65 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Almost all these hydrocarbons come from a Jurassic source and the main reservoirs and traps are Jurassic sandstones in fault blocks and Paleocene sandstones or Cretaceous chalks in gentle domes. The article describes four major fields---Ekofisk, Gullfaks, Ormen Lange and Sn{\o}hvit--- to illustrate some of the many challenges in developing and producing the hydrocarbons. Elsewhere in Norden, there has been much less exploration. Drilling results have mostly been negative in mainland Sweden, onshore Denmark, onshore Svalbard and on- and offshore West Greenland. Minor oil finds have been made in Palaeozoic rocks in the Baltic Sea. The first wells have recently been drilled off the Faroe Islands, resulting in one discovery. No drilling has taken place on- or offshore East Greenland. As a result of the hydrocarbon activities in Norway and Denmark, petroleum geoscience there has flourished, with 2000 geoscientists currently employed in the industry, many technical innovations made, a  wealth of publically available information and a great increase in the understanding of the geology.},

  abstract     = {The Colorado Plateau is blanketed by Phanerozoic marine and nonmarine strata as young as Cretaceous that are now exposed at elevations of about 2 km. Crustal thickening due to magmatism and horizontal crustal shortening was far less than necessary to cause this uplift, which is commonly attributed to the consequences of mantle lithosphere thinning and heating. The Colorado Plateau and the midcontinent region around Iowa consist of Precambrian bedrock overlain by a similar amount of Paleozoic platformal strata, and thus both regions once had similar lithospheric buoyancy, Mesozoic sedimentation increased the crustal thickness and lithospheric buoyancy of the Colorado Plateau relative to the midcontinent region. Backstripping calculations yield elevation without these sediments and lead to a calculated elevation difference between the two areas of about 1200 m, which represents unexplained plateau uplift. Review of constraints on uplift timing finds little support for a late Cenozoic uplift age and allows early to middle Cenozoic uplift, which is consistent with uplift mechanisms related to low-angle subduction that ended in the middle Cenozoic. Finite element heat flow calculations of low-angle subduction and lithosphere attenuation, using a range of initial lithosphere thicknesses and degree of attenuation, indicate that required uplift can result from tectonic removal of about 120 km of mantle lithosphere from an initially 200-km-thick lithosphere. This allows for partial preservation of North American mantle lithosphere with its distinctive isotopic signature in some late Cenozoic volcanic rocks and is consistent with normal Pn velocities in the uppermost mantle beneath the plateau.},

  abstract     = {The sediment composition of deep-sea cores from the central Arctic Ocean, the Fram Strait, and the Yermak Plateau was analyzed for several parameters to reconstruct the history of marine paleoenvironment and terrestrial glaciation in the last 200,000 years. Layers with high amounts of coarse, terrigenous ice-rafted debris (IRD) and often high contents of smectite were deposited during extensive glaciations in northern Eurasia, when ice sheets reached the northern continental margins of the Barents and Kara seas and discharged icebergs into the Arctic Ocean. Intercalated layers with relatively low IRD and smectite contents, but abundant planktic foraminifers in the coarse fraction were deposited during periods of Atlantic Water inflow to the Arctic Ocean and seasonally open waters (leads) in a sea ice cover with only few icebergs in the Arctic Ocean. High IRD contents in the sediments reflect the presence of ice sheets on the Kara and Barents seas shelves and the hinterland during the entire oxygen isotope stage 6 (ca 190-130ka), in substage 5b (ca 90-80ka), at the stage boundary 5/4 (around 75ka), and in late stage 4/early stage 3 (ca 65-50ka). These results are in excellent correlation with those from recent field work in northern Scandinavia, European Russia, Siberia, and on the shelves. Relatively low amounts of IRD in central Arctic Ocean sediments from the Late Weichselian glacial maximum (ca 24-18ka) correlate well with the recent reconstruction of a very limited eastern ice sheet extension during this time. Oxygen and carbon isotope records of planktic foraminifers from the analyzed sediment cores show a number of prominent excursions which can be interpreted as evidence for freshwater events in the Arctic Ocean. The synchroneity of freshwater events and IRD input suggests a common source. Strongest events were associated with deglaciations of the Barents and Kara seas after the ice sheets had blocked the outflow of large rivers for several millennia. The outflow of freshwater from large ice-dammed lakes occurred at ca 130, 80-75, and 52ka. Freshwater events in the central Arctic Ocean during the last deglaciation (ca 18ka) were relatively small compared to the previous events. This indicates that during most of the Late Weichselian glacial maximum a river outflow from northern Siberia to the Arctic Ocean was possible. Atlantic Water inflow to the Arctic Ocean and seasonally open waters in the ice (leads) occurred during the interglacials of oxygen isotope stage 1 and substage 5e, during several interstadials (stage 3, substages 5a and 5c), and to a lesser degree within stadials and glacials (stages 2, 4, and 6). With the exception of the interglacials, these periods were times of strong ice growth on the continents as revealed by terrestrial data. The coincidence suggests that open waters in the Arctic Ocean and the Nordic Seas were an important moisture source (in addition to more southerly sources) which fostered the growth of ice sheets on northern Eurasia. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Subsequent to the LGM, the ice sheets disappeared and the solid Earth readjusted towards a new isostatic equilibrium. The glacial isostatic adjustment process is documented in numerous observations, for example, palaeoshorelines covering the last deglaciation phase, and ongoing crustal deformations monitored by GPS stations, for example, the BIFROST project. In this study, we use palaeoshoreline data from Scandinavia, the Barents Sea and northwestern Europe (NW) as well as radial crustal velocities from the BIFROST campaign to infer the radial viscosity structure of the Earth's mantle underneath Scandinavia and NW Europe. A global inverse procedure based on the Neighbourhood Algorithm allows us to explore the hypothesis of a low-viscosity zone in the upper mantle, which has been proposed in the literature. Our results indicate a low-viscosity zone underneath the Barents Sea, with viscosities between 10(19) and 10(20) Pa s in a depth interval of 160-200 km. No such low-viscosity zone is found underneath Scandinavia, and no clear indication for such a zone underneath NW Europe. The thickness of the rheological lithosphere increases from 60 to 70 km underneath NW Europe and the Barents Sea towards values exceeding 120 km underneath Scandinavia.},

It is shown here that two of the most prominent North Atlantic events-the rapid warming that marks the end of the last glacial period and the Bolling/Allerod-Younger Dryas oscillation-are also recorded in an ice core from Taylor Dome, in the western Ross Sea sector of Antarctica. This result contrasts with evidence from ice cores in other regions of Antarctica, which show an asynchronous response between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.},

Lake sediments radiocarbon dated to between 14 and {\textgreater}52 ka, coupled to 10Be and 26Al exposure ages {\textgreater}35 ka from adjacent moraines and bedrock, demonstrate that some coastal uplands remained above the limits of continental glaciation throughout oxygen isotope stage 2. At lower elevations, exposure ages from a flight of distinct lateral moraines range from 10 to 35 ka, and imply that low-gradient outlet glaciers reached the outer coast during the late Wisconsinan. Collectively, these results reconcile terrestrial evidence for the presence of ice-free refugia through the late Wisconsinan with marine evidence for extensive outlet glaciers in the major fiords and bays of eastern Baffin Island.},

  abstract     = {Plate tectonics is the horizontal motion of Earth's thermal boundary layer (lithosphere) over the convecting mantle (asthenosphere) and is mostly driven by lithosphere sinking in subduction zones. Plate tectonics is an outstanding example of a self organizing, far from equilibrium complex system (SOFFECS), driven by the negative buoyancy of the thermal boundary layer and controlled by dissipation in the bending lithosphere and viscous mantle. Plate tectonics is an unusual way for a silicate planet to lose heat, as it exists on only one of the large five silicate bodies in the inner solar system. It is not known when this mode of tectonic activity and heat loss began on Earth. All silicate planets probably experienced a short-lived magma ocean stage. After this solidified, stagnant lid behavior is the common mode of planetary heat loss, with interior heat being lost by delamination and "hot spot" volcanism and shallow intrusions. Decompression melting in the hotter early Earth generated a different lithosphere than today, with thicker oceanic crust and thinner mantle lithosphere; such lithosphere would take much longer than at present to become negatively buoyant, suggesting that plate tectonics on the early Earth occurred sporadically if at all. Plate tectonics became sustainable (the modern style) when Earth cooled sufficiently that decompression melting beneath spreading ridges made thin oceanic crust, allowing oceanic lithosphere to become negatively buoyant after a few tens of millions of years. Ultimately the question of when plate tectonics began must be answered by information retrieved from the geologic record. Criteria for the operation of plate tectonics includes ophiolites, blueschist and ultra-high pressure metamorphic belts, eclogites, passive margins, transform faults, paleomagnetic demonstration of different motions of different cratons, and the presence of diagnostic geochemical and isotopic indicators in igneous rocks. This record must be interpreted individually; I interpret the record to indicate a progression of tectonic styles from active Archean tectonics and magmatism to something similar to plate tectonics at similar to 1.9 Ga to sustained, modern style plate tectonics with deep subduction - and powerful slab pull - beginning in Neoproterozoic time.},

  abstract     = {Complexly deformed late Archean to Mesoproterozoic rocks of the western Gawler Craton are poorly exposed, thus reducing the ability to extract meaningful geological, structural and tectonic information. This study focuses on shear zone analysis via a constrained integration of qualitative aeromagnetic and Bouguer gravity data interpretation with quantitative two-dimensional forward modeling. This integration provides a means to interpret the crustal architecture as well as constrain a sequence of events, which aid the interpretation of a tectonic history for the western Gawler Craton. Results indicate a polyphase shearing history dominated by a crustal-scale array of predominantly west-dipping shear zones. The initiation of ??? east-west trending SZ1 structures was likely coincident with ca. 1750-1720 Ma crustal extension, high heat flow and deposition on thinned areas of Archean crust with the development of a dense, possibly underplated lower crustal component. SZ1-R2 dextral transpressional movements reactivated SZ1 during the ca. 1720-1670 Ma Kimban Orogeny, which is interpreted to record collision between the Gawler Craton and the North Australian Craton. During this event basins marginal to, and in the interior of the Archean crustal block of the western Gawler Craton were inverted and the dense lower crust was vertically offset, causing some of the long wavelength (??? 30-50 km) Bouguer gravity anomalies presently observed. Shear zone activity is constrained until ca. 1680 Ma during which time subduction rollback established a new arc position at the southern margin of the Archean crust with magmatism persisting until ca. 1670 Ma. SZ3 structures overprint and offset the interpreted axis of the Kimban Orogeny within the Archean crust. These structures record a major phase of crustal-scale sinistral strike-slip movement associated with ??? north-south shortening between ca. 1630 and 1540 Ma prior to their reactivation at ca. 1450 Ma. This SZ3-R4 reactivation is interpreted to cause southwest-directed crustal transport, which was focused as west-side-up movements internal to the Archean continent, whereas dextral strike-slip was focused at a major rheological boundary between thick Archean crust to the south and thick Paleoproterozoic basins to the north. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This lithologic-scale chemical heterogeneity may survive in the mantle for as long as the age of Earth because chemical diffusion is inefficient. Estimates of rates of subduction and mantle processing over geologic history indicate that most or all of the mantle may be composed of lithologically heterogeneous material. Mineralogical models of the mantle show that chemical heterogeneity over many decades in length scale may be detectable by geophysical probes via its influence on seismic-wave propagation. Grain-scale heterogeneity influences the aggregate absolute seismic velocity and its lateral variation with temperature. The elastic-wave velocity contrast associated with lithologic-scale heterogeneity may be sufficient to produce observable scattering of short-period seismic waves.},

An additional high coercivity phase, probably hematite, is present throughout the entire record in low concentrations. Rockmagnetic results indicate the possible postdepositional dissolution of (titano-) magnetite and the authigenic growth of greigite in one confined section. A positive correlation between initial magnetic susceptibility (??) and sediment accumulation rate and between ?? and the non-arboreal pollen percentage is observed while ?? and organic carbon content show a negative correlation.

  abstract     = {A regional correlation of Neogene stratigraphy has been attempted along and across the NW European Atlantic continental margin, between Mid-Norway and SW Ireland. Two unconformity-bounded successions are recognised. These are referred to as the lower and upper Neogene successions, and have been dated as Miocene-early Pliocene and early Pliocene-Holocene, respectively, in age. Their development is interpreted to reflect plate-wide, tectonically driven changes in the sedimentary, oceanographic and latterly climatic evolution of the NE Atlantic region. The lower Neogene succession mainly preserves a record of deep-water sedimentation that indicates an expansion of contourite sediment drifts above submarine unconformities, within this succession, on both sides of the eastern Greenland-Scotland Ridge from the mid-Miocene. This is interpreted to record enhanced deep-water exchange through the Faroe Conduit (deepest part of the Southern Gateway), and can be linked to compressive inversion of the Wyville-Thomson Ridge Complex. Thus, a pervasive, interconnected Arctic-North Atlantic deep-water circulation system is a Neogene phenomenon. The upper Neogene succession records a regional change, at about 4 Ma, in the patterns of contourite sedimentation (submarine erosion, new depocentres) coeval with the onset of rapid seaward-progradation of the continental margin by up to 100 km. This build-out of the shelf and slope is inferred to record a marked increase in sediment supply in response to uplift and tilting of the continental margin. Associated changes in deep-water circulation may be part of an Atlantic-wide reorganisation of ocean bottom currents. Glacial sediments form a major component of the prograding shelf margin (shelf-slope) sediment wedges, but stratigraphic data indicate that the onset of progradation pre-dates significant high-latitude glaciation by at least 1 Ma, and expansive Northern Hemisphere glaciation by at least 3 Ma. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract     = {The Transantarctic Mountains are a major geologic boundary that bisects the Antarctic continent, separating the low-lying, tectonically active terrains of West Antarctica from the East Antarctic craton. A new comprehensive aerogeophysical data set, extending 1150 km from the Ross Sea into the interior of East Antarctica provides insights into the complex structure inland of the Transantarctic Mountains. Geophysical maps, compiled from 21 000 km of gravity, magnetic and subglacial topography data, outline the boundaries of several geologic and tectonic segments within the survey area. The coherent pattern in magnetic data and mesa topography suggests a subglacial extent of the Transantarctic Mountains 400-500 km inland the last exposed rock outcrops. We estimate the maximum thickness of a potential sediment infill in the Wilkes Subglacial Basin to be less than 1 km, based on gravity modeling and source depth estimates from magnetic data. The coherent nature of the potential field and topography data, together with the northwest-southeast trends, define the Adventure Subglacial Trench and the Resolution Subglacial Highlands as a tectonic unit. The crustal structure and the strong similarity of the observed gravity with fold-and-thrust belts suggest a compressional scenario for the origin of the Adventure Subglacial Trench and the Resolution Subglacial Highlands. The complexity and apparent structural control of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin raise the issue of what influence pre-existing structures may have played in the formation of the Transantarctic Mountains system. The previous hypothesis of a thermal boundary beneath the mountains is difficult to reconcile with our new gravity data. The apparent difficulties to match our new data with certain key aspects of previous models suggests that a reassessment of the existing uplift models is necessary. We have modeled the prominent gravity anomaly over the Transantarctic Mountains with thicker crust. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {Aerogeophysical and seismological data from a geophysical survey in the interior of East Antarctica were used to develop a conceptual tectonic model for the Lake Vostok region. The model is constrained using three independent data sets: magnetic, seismic, and gravimetric. A distinct change in the aeromagnetic anomaly character across Lake Vostok defines a crustal boundary. Depth to magnetic basement estimates image a 400-km-wide and more than 10-km-deep sedimentary basin west of the lake. Analysis of teleseismic earthquakes suggests a relatively thin crust beneath Lake Vostok consistent with predictions from kinematic and flexural gravity modelling. Magnetic, gravity, and subglacial topography data reveal a tectonic boundary within East Antarctica. Based on our kinematic and flexural gravity modelling, this tectonic boundary appears to be the result of thrust sheet emplacement onto an earlier passive continental margin. No data presently exist to date directly either the timing of passive margin formation or the subsequent shortening phase. The preserved thrust sheet thickness is related to the thickness of the passive margin crust. Because a significant amount of time is required to erode the thrust sheet topography, we suggest that these tectonic events are Proterozoic in age. Minor normal reactivation of the thrust sheet offers a simple mechanism to explain the formation of the Lake Vostok Basin. A low level of seismicity exists in the vicinity of this tectonic boundary. The existence of a crustal boundary in the Antarctic interior provides new constraints on the Proterozoic architecture of the East Antarctic craton. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

This paper presents observations of the currently surging glacier Skobreen, in southern Spitsbergen. The study Is based on examinations of new and archival photographs and maps. Skobreen, an 18 km(2) valley glacier terminating into the lower part of the glacier Paulabreen, has not been registered previously as a surging glacier. Skobreen experienced a build-up in its upper part, while there has been a lowering of the surface in the terminal region. Photographs from 1990 show incipient crevassing in the Upper part. Photographs from 2003 show a slight advance of the terminus and marginal crevassing, indicating all initiation period of about 15 years for a surge of this glacier. In June 2005 transverse crevassing appeared ill the upper part of the glacier, while the middle section moved as a block with strong shear martins and a pronounced drawdown of the ice surface. No traces of a surge front could be seen in the crevasse pattern. However, the crevasse pattern indicates an initiation area in the transition zone between the transverse crevassing in the upper part and the block of ice in the middle region.},

The surge development could be followed through three stages, of which the first two had not been previously described in Svalbard. The first two stages are mainly identified from glacier thickness changes and showed little visual evidence. In stage 1, initial surface lowering was found in the upper part of the glacier, followed by a thickening further down-glacier in stage 2. Stage 3 represents the period of well-developed surge dynamics that is usually reported. Some surges ceased at stage 2 as a partial surge and never developed into a fully active surge. These partial surges could be misinterpreted as rapid response to climate change. The results of this study further support previous findings that the majority of Svalbard glaciers are of surge type.},

The reconstructed ice limits are based on satellite data and aerial photographs combined with geological field investigations in Russia and Siberia, and with marine seismic- and sediment core data. The Barents-Kara Ice Sheet got progressively smaller during each glaciation, whereas the dimensions of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet increased. During the last Ice Age the Barents-Kara Ice Sheet attained its maximum size as early as 90-80,000 years ago when the ice front reached far onto the continent. A regrowth of the ice sheets occurred during the early Middle Weichselian, culminating about 60-50,000 years ago. During the Late Weichselian the Barents-Kara Ice Sheet did not reach the mainland east of the Kanin Peninsula, with the exception of the NW fringe of Taimyr. A numerical ice-sheet model, forced by global sea level and solar changes, was run through the full Weichselian glacial cycle. The modeling results are roughly compatible with the geological record of ice growth, but the model underpredicts the glaciations in the Eurasian Arctic during the Early and Middle Weichselian. One reason for this is that the climate in the Eurasian Arctic was not as dry then as during the Late Weichselian glacial maximum. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {The deglaciation of the continental shelf to the west of Spitsbergen and the main fjord, Isfjorden, is discussed based on sub-bottom seismic records and sediment cores. The sea floor on the shelf to the west of Isfjorden is underlain by less than 2 m of glaciomarine sediments over a firm diamicton interpreted as till. In central Isfjorden up to 10 m of deglaciation sediments were recorded, whereas in cores from the innermost tributary, Billefjorden, less than a meter of ice proximal sediments was recognized between the till and the 'normal' Holocene marine sediments. We conclude that the Barents Sea Ice Sheet terminated along the shelf break during the Late Weichselian glacial maximum. Radiocarbon dates from the glaciomarine sediments above the till indicate a stepwise deglaciation. Apparently the ice front retreated from the outermost shelf around 14.8 ka. A dramatic increase in the flux of fine-grained glaciomarine sediments around 13 ka is assumed to reflect increased melting and/or current activity due to a climatic warming. This second stage of deglaciation was interrupted by a glacial readvance culminating on the mid-shelf area shortly after 12.4 ka. The glacial readvance, which is correlated with a simultaneous readvance of the Fennoscandian ice sheet along the western coast of Norway, is attributed to the so-called 'Older Dryas' cooling event in the North Atlantic region. Following this glacial readvance the outer part of Isfjorden became rapidly deglaciated around 12.3 ka. During the Younger Dryas the inner fjord branches were occupied by large outlet glaciers and possibly the ice front terminated far out in the main fjord. The remnants of the Barents Sea Ice Sheet melted quickly away as a response to the Holocene warming around 10 ka.},

A low content of glacially derived coal, absence of regular laminations and a slow sedimentation rate in the lower part of the lacustrine sediments indicate that the former glaciers that existed within the catchment area during the last ice age melted quickly away as a result of the Younger Dryas-Holocene warming, and during the next 6000 years there were no glaciers in the valley. Increasing coal content, incipient laminations and rising sedimentation rates indicate that the glacier Linnebreen started to form 4000-5000 years ago, probably as a response to the late-Holocene cooling. The Holocene maximum extent of the glacier occurred during the 'Little Ice Age', starting with a pronounced ice advance in the thirteenth or fourteenth century. A well-dated core from Billefjorden, which is assumed to reflect glacial fluctuations in the inner part of the Isfjorden area, indicates a similar development to that in the valley Linnedalen. No glacial signal was recorded during the early and mid-Holocene. The present tide water glaciers started to form 3000-4000 years ago, with glacial maxima around 500 cal.

In the southeast Gawler Craton, dextral transpression was focussed into the {\textgreater}250 km long Kalinjala Shear Zone, which dominates the structural character of that part of the craton. Monazite in upper amphibolite facies shear fabrics within the Kalinjala Shear Zone give a mean age of 1682 ?? 10 Ma. This is indistinguishable from an age of 1693 ?? 16 Ma obtained from monazite inclusions within garnet porphyroclasts within the shear fabric. In the western Gawler Craton, monazite populations from two separate locations along the {\textgreater}400 km long Tallacootra Shear Zone give ages of 1680 ?? 37 and 1679 ?? 39 Ma, respectively, suggesting that both the Kalinjala and Tallacootra Shear Zone systems record regional-scale strain partitioning toward the end of the ca. 1730-1700 Ma Kimban Orogeny. In the northwest Gawler Craton, the Karari Fault Zone can be traced for {\textgreater}700 km, and separates late Archaean rocks from an assembly of tectonic terranes that comprise the northern and northwest Gawler Craton. Monazites from amphibolite-grade mylonites associated with the Karari Fault Zone have a mean age of 1631 ?? 12 Ma. This age is identical to the timing of regional arc-like magmatism represented by the St. Peter Suite in the central Gawler Craton, and suggests that exhumation of the ca. 1650-1640 Ma ultra high-grade granulites of the Nawa Domain in the northwest Gawler Craton was linked to the development of the St. Peter Suite magmatic margin. In the central Gawler Craton, monazite in the {\textgreater}200 km long Yerda Shear Zone, which sheared granites belonging to the ca. 1580 Ma Hiltaba Suite, have a mean age of 1503 ?? 16 Ma. Similar ages of 1516 ?? 18 and 1508 ?? 14 Ma are obtained from monazite inclusions in garnet porphyroclasts within mylonites along the {\textgreater}300 km long Coorabie Fault Zone in the western Gawler Craton. Younger ages of 1468 ?? 12 and 1457 ?? 22 Ma from the amphibolite-grade mylonitic fabrics in the Coorabie Fault Zone are similar to 
                        40Ar-
                        39Ar ages from the western Gawler Craton, and suggest that reactivation of the Coorabie Shear Zone in part was associated with regional cooling and stabilisation of the Gawler Craton at ca. 1450 Ma. The history of deformation on the terrane-scale shear zones in the Gawler Craton therefore does not reflect a single period of terrane assembly or reworking, rather it points to a complex pattern of strain partitioning during tectonic events in the late Palaeoproterozoic to early Mesoproterozoic. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Interpretation of this information can give velocities with meaningful accuracy for primary as well as multiple events. In addition, the velocity data can help correctly label events.

  abstract     = {Whilst the interplay between tectonics, glaciation and oceanography is reasonably well understood on some high-latitude margins, relatively little is known about the nature of Quaternary processes affecting the continental margin north of the Faeroe Islands. We therefore present side-scan sonar (GLORIA and TOBI) and 3.5 kHz data in combination with a new regional bathymetry in order to characterise and analyse the margin's physiography and the sedimentary processes that have occurred in the area during the Late Quaternary. Seven acoustic facies are identified and interpreted, in combination with published core records. The margin is subject to differing sedimentation regimes over glacial/interglacial cycles, relating to the changing importance of contouritic, hemipelagic, glacimarine and mass-movement processes. Mass movement is much more extensive than previously thought, with a total sediment volume of {\textgreater}2000 km3, similar to that of the Storegga Slide (5500 km3) and may occur primarily at glacial terminations. The downslope limit of instabilities is associated with a series of channels, focusing the deposition of distal, turbiditic sediments into the regional deep beyond. Together with glacigenic debris flows from the western margin of the North Sea Fan, mass-movement processes are identified to have affected 52-70{\%} of the North Faeroes margin area. In contrast, distal glacimarine sedimentation, alternating with hemipelagic and contouritic development, is found on the remaining 30-48{\%} of the margin during glacials, and hemipelagic and contouritic Sedimentation are active across 90{\%} of the margin in interglacial conditions. Despite a lack of any local, direct glacial influence, these observations on the relative importance of sedimentation processes are comparable with other glacially influenced passive margins.

Techniques for a spherical harmonic analysis of the gravity field are used to compute both the gravity disturbances and the topographic and bathymetric corrections with a spectral resolution complete to degree 180 of the spherical harmonics. The ice stripping correction is computed with a spectral resolution complete to degree 90. The sediment and consolidated crust stripping corrections are computed in spatial form by forward modeling their respective attractions. All data are evaluated on a 1 x 1 arc degree grid at the Earth's surface and provided in Data Sets S1-S5 in the auxiliary material for the scientific community for use in global geophysical studies. The complete crust-stripped gravity disturbances (globally having a range of 1050 mGal) contain the gravitational signal coming dominantly from the global mantle lithosphere (upper mantle) morphology and density composition and partially from the sublithospheric density heterogeneities. Large errors are expected because of uncertainties of the CRUST 2.0 model (i.e., deviations of the CRUST 2.0 model density from the real Earth's crustal density heterogeneities and the Moho relief uncertainties).},

  abstract     = {DSDP/ODP drilling in the northern North Atlantic reveals that so far the onset of northern hemisphere cooling deduced from the occurrence of ice-rafted debris (IRD) in deep-sea sediments can be traced back to the middle Miocene. The Greenland ice sheet has probably the longest history on the northern hemisphere. Leg 151 site 909 (Fram Strait) recovered a unique continuous sediment record dating from early/middle Miocene. The composition of the coarse fraction indicates that the oldest IRD pulses are documented around 14 Ma in the Fram Strait (site 909) and around 12.6 Ma on the Voring Plateau (leg 104, site 642) in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea. Fram Strait site 909 indicates a further stepwise increase of northern hemisphere cooling by several IRD pulses during late Miocene (between 10.8 and 8.6 Ma, around 7.2, 6.8 and 6.3 Ma), which ultimately led to a drastic intensification of northern hemisphere glaciation during Plio-Pleistocene. The deep-sea sediment records show that Plio-Pleistocene strengthening of IRD pulses have been observed since approximately 4.0 Ma in the westernmost Norwegian-Greenland Sea and Labrador Sea; by contrast, strengthening of IRD pulses are observed at approximately 3.2-2.7 Ma on the eastern side of the Norwegian-Greenland Sea, including the Barents Sea margin. Sediment composition and physical properties of the drilled, mostly terrigenous sections reveal that orbital parameters have controlled major aspects of shallow and deep-water environments with frequency domains related to 41 ka periods of obliquity dominant in the pre-glacial Miocene, Pliocene and early Quaternary and to 100 ka periods of eccentricity dominant during the past 600,000-700,000 years. The stratigraphy of ice-rafted material reveals a frequently and rapidly changing history of the dynamics of various segments in ice sheets around the Norwegian-Greenland Sea. It is particularly evident from the composition of the ice-rafted material that the Eurasian ice sheets delivered IRD to the eastern part of the Norwegian-Greenland Sea, whereas Greenland source areas are represented in the drill sites of the east Greenland continental margin and in the Labrador Sea. The stratigraphic sequences on the Yermak Plateau suggest that the Svalbard ice sheet may have extended far to the north prior to oxygen isope stage 16 but not since then. Invasions of temperate Atlantic waters during interglacials can be observed as short-lived and rather irregular events. It never reached the area off eastern Greenland except during the Pliocene interval, when tundra floras were able to develop on north-eastern Greenland and planktonic foraminifers suggesting the presence of temperate water masses in the Fram Strait as been documented in the drill sites from the Yermak Plateau.},

  abstract     = {Recordings of seismic events that sample the deep mantle can test different hypotheses of mantle processes and composition. Seismic reflections from structures in the D$\prime$ region - the bottom 200-400km of the Earth's mantle - can provide information on the velocity contrasts in this region. By studying the waveforms and polarities of the D$\prime$ reflections in P and S-waves, we can potentially distinguish between different explanations for the observed structures, such as phase transitions, mineral texture or thermal anomalies. Here we use source-receiver combinations that contain reflections from D$\prime$ in two different regions that are both characterised by fast seismic velocities in tomographic models. Beneath the Caribbean a positive S-velocity contrast but negative P-wave velocity contrast across the D$\prime$ reflector has been reported previously, consistent with a model of a phase change in MgSiO3. In the second fast velocity region (Eurasia) we detect positive P- and S-wave velocity contrasts in two orthogonal paths crossing in the lowermost mantle indicating a different scenario for D$\prime$. A path that crosses this region in 45{$^{\circ}$} to the other two great circle paths shows evidence for a negative P velocity contrast. One explanation to reconcile observations in both regions is a phase transition from perovskite to post-perovskite with a fraction of 12{\%} preferred crystal alignment in the post-perovskite phase. Depending on the travel direction of the waves with respect to the flow direction in the lower mantle, positive or negative velocity jumps can be expected. Other anisotropic models are considered but cannot fully explain the range of observations we find in the data. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

We use a 14C- and 210Pb-dated surface core from Lake CF8 on north- eastern Baffin Island, Arctic Canada to generate a high-resolution multiproxy reconstruction of climate and environmental change. Throughout the late Holocene, primary productivity in Lake CF8 was low, but increased almost 20-fold in the past 200 years. Insect (Chironomidae) assemblages also show dramatic changes since 1950 AD, with cold stenothermous chironomid taxa disappearing from the record altogether. These changes in productivity and chironomid assemblages are unprecedented in the past 5,000 years. The dramatic ecological shifts that occurred at Lake CF8 have also been observed elsewhere in the Arctic, and will likely continue at ever-increasing rates as anthropogenic inputs of green house gases continue to cause climate warming and enhanced lacustrine primary production.},

  abstract     = {With accelerated melting of alpine glaciers, understanding the future state of the cryosphere is critical. Because the observational record of glacier response to climate change is short, palaeo-records of glacier change are needed. Using proglacial lake sediments, which contain continuous and datable records of past glacier activity, we investigate Holocene glacier fluctuations on northeastern Baffin Island. Basal radiocarbon ages from three lakes constrain Laurentide Ice Sheet retreat by ca. 10.5 ka. High sedimentation rates (0.03cma?1) and continuous minerogenic sedimen- tation throughout the Holocene in proglacial lakes, in contrast to organic-rich sediments and low sedimentation rates (0.005cma?1) in neighbouring non-glacial lakes, suggest that glaciers may have persisted in proglacial lake catchments since regional deglaciation. The presence of varves and relatively high magnetic susceptibility from 10 to 6 ka and since 2 ka in one proglacial lake suggest minimum Holocene glacier extent ca. 6--2 ka. Moraine evidence and proglacial and threshold lake sediments indicate that the maximum Holocene glacier extent occurred during the Little Ice Age. The finding that glaciers likely persisted through the Holocene is surprising, given that regional proxy records reveal summer temperatures several degrees warmer than today, and may be due to shorter ablation seasons and greater accumulation-season precipitation.},

Using a composite of four records, the cold event is observed as a 160.5 yr period during which decadal-mean isotopic values were below average, within which there is a central event of 69 yr during which values were consistently more than one standard deviation below the average for the preceding period. Four cores in north, south, and central Greenland show differences at decadal and shorter timescales; it is not yet clear if this represents significant spatial differences in response. The results show clear evidence for colder temperatures and a decrease in snow-accumulation rate. However, the changes in chemical concentrations for the ions looked at here are small, suggesting only minor changes in atmospheric circulation for this event. Apart from the decrease in methane concentration, Greenland ice cores give only weak evidence for effects outside the North Atlantic region. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we have analyzed magnetite (Fe3O4) crystals acid-extracted from carbonate globules in Martian meteorite ALH84001. We studied 594 magnetites from ALH84001 and grouped them into three populations on the basis of morphology: 389 were irregularly shaped, 164 were elongated prisms, and 41 were whisker-like. As a possible terrestrial analog for the ALH84001 elongated prisms, we compared these magnetites with those produced by the terrestrial magnetotactic bacteria strain MV-1. By TEM again, we examined 206 magnetites recovered from strain MV-1 cells. Natural (Darwinian) selection in terrestrial magnetotactic bacteria appears to have resulted in the formation of intracellular magnetite crystals having the physical and chemical properties that optimize their magnetic moment. In this study, we describe six properties of magnetite produced by biologically controlled mechanisms (e.g., magnetotactic bacteria), properties that, collectively, are not observed in any known population of inorganic magnetites. These criteria can be used to distinguish one of the modes of origin for magnetites from samples with complex or unknown histories. Of the ALH84001 magnetites that we have examined, the elongated prismatic magnetite particles ($\sim$27{\%} of the total) are indistinguishable from the MV-1 magnetites in five of these six characteristics observed for biogenically controlled mineralization of magnetite crystals.

Search engines, internet advertising systems, product recommendation systems are sample users of these algorithm-intensive code and libraries. Machine learning code and toolkits have also been used in many recent studies on software mining and analytics that aim to automate various software engineering tasks. With the increasing number of important applications of machine learning systems, the reliability of such systems is also becoming increasingly important. A necessary step for ensuring reliability of such systems is to understand the features and characteristics of bugs occurred in the systems. A number of studies have investigated bugs and fixes in various software systems, but none focuses on machine learning systems. Machine learning systems are unique due to their algorithm-intensive nature and applications to potentially large-scale data, and thus deserve a special consideration. In this study, we fill the research gap by performing an empirical study on the bugs in machine learning systems. We analyze three systems, Apache Mahout, Lucene, and OpenNLP, which are data mining, information retrieval, and natural language processing tools respectively. We look into their bug databases and code repositories, analyze a sample set of bugs and corresponding fixes, and label the bugs into various categories. Our study finds that 22.6{\%} of the bugs belong to the algorithm/method category, 15.6{\%} of the bugs belong to the non-functional category, and 13{\%} of the bugs belong to the assignment/initialization category. We also report the relationship between bug categories and bug severities, the time and effort needed to fix the bugs, and bug impacts. We highlight several bug categories that deserve attention in future research.},

Reconstructions based on these and recently published rotation parameters document a relatively stationary position of Broken Ridge abutted against Central Kerguelen Plateau between chron 34 (83 Ma) and chron 20 (43 Ma), prior to the commencement of seafloor spreading between the two Late Cretaceous features. These reconstructions are significant as they are the first which are consistent with geological and geophysical constraints in not producing an overlap of Broken Ridge and Kerguelen Plateau between chron 34 and chron 24 (53 Ma) and not requiring significant extension or strike-slip motion within Kerguelen Plateau. We also find that the finite rotations for chrons 20 to 34 outline the area of rough topography inferred from the satellite-derived free-air gravity for the Diamantina Zone and Labuan Basin. A consequence of these rotations is that there is considerable overlap of continental crust in the region of Tasmania, the South Tasman Rise and East Antarctica in the Late Cretaceous. Solutions to this problem may imply either post-Santonian ($\leq$79 Ma) extension or transform motion in the Bass Strait, or late Cretaceous or Cenozoic extension in Wilkes Land. The reconstructions also agree with prior estimates of roughly 150 km of motion between East and West Antartica since chron 20. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Reconstructions based on our revised anomaly identifications are characterized by a surprisingly large amount of continental overlap, involving the South Tasman Rise, Tasmania, and the Victoria Land region of Antarctica. The overlap is due to continental extension and/or deformation of oceanic crust in the Australian-Antarctic Basin. The second hypothesis would imply that the magnetic anomalies older than chron 31 in the Australian-Antarctic Basin are not isochrons. We also fmd evidence for a previously unrecognized period of extremely slow spreading on the Southeast Indian Ridge from chron 31 (68.7 Ma) to chron 24 (53.3 Ma) in the Australian- Antarctic Basin. In the western end of the basin we have tentatively identified a hiatus in the generation of crustal accretion associated with a minimum sustainable threshold half spreading rate of 1.5 mm/yr. In addition, we recognize a new fracture zone on the Antarctic plate, the Vincennes fracture zone, as the conjugate to the Perth fracture zone on the Australian plate, in the western Australian-Antarctic Basin.

The 3-D image of the density-vS coupling provides unprecedented detail of information on the compositional and thermal contributions to density structures. The accurate and high-resolution crustal model allows us to compute a reliable residual topography to understand the dynamic implications of our models. The correlation between residual topography and mantle residual gravity anomalies defines three large-scale regions where upper mantle dynamics produce surface expression: the East European Craton; the eastern side of the Arabian Plate; and the Mediterranean Basin. The effects of mantle convection are also clearly visible at: (1) the Eastern Sirt Embayment; (2) the West African Craton northern margins; (3) the volcanically active region of the Canarian Archipelago; (4) the northern edge of the Central European Volcanic Province; and (5) the Northeastern part of the Atlantic Ocean, between Greenland and Iceland. Strong connections are observed among areas of weak radial anisotropy and areas where the mantle dynamics show surface expression. Although both thermal and additional dependencies have been incorporated into the density model, convective down-welling in the mantle below the East European Craton is required to explain the strong correlation between the estimated negative mantle residual anomalies and the negative residual topography.},

A statistically positive fold test and remanences carried by typical high-temperature oxidation (deuteric) minerals support a primary magnetic signature. U/Pb ages from MIS (771-751 Ma) overlap with those for granitoids and dolerite dykes from the Seychelles microcontinent (mainly 748-755 Ma), and palaeomagnetic data for both entities can be matched with a tight reconstruction fit (Seychelles ??? India: Euler latitude = 25.8??N, longitude = 330??E, rotation angle = 28??). In this Neoproterozoic time interval, MIS and the Seychelles must have been located at intermediate northerly latitudes along the western margin of Rodinia, with magmatism that probably originated in a continental arc. The most reliable, dated palaeomagnetic data (?? 756 Ma) from MIS, Seychelles and Australia require a crucial reappraisal of the timing and plate dynamics of Rodinia break-up and Gondwana assemblage. These new data necessitate an entirely different fit of East Gondwana elements than previously proposed, and also call to question the validity of the Southwest US-East Antarctic and Australia-Southwest US models. The palaeomagnetic data mandate that Greater India was located west of Australia rather than forming a conjugate margin with East Antarctica in the Mid-Neoptroterozoic. Break-up of Rodinia along western Laurentia may therefore have taken place along two major Neoproterozoic rifts; one leading to separation of Laurentia and Australia-East Antarctica, and the second between Australia and India. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract     = {Gondwana is reviewed from the unification of its several cratons in the Late Neoproterozoic, through its combination with Laurussia in the Carboniferous to form Pangea and up to its progressive fragmentation in the Mesozoic. For much of that time it was the largest continental unit on Earth, covering almost 100million km2, and its remnants constitute 64{\%} of all land areas today. New palaeogeographical reconstructions are presented, ranging from the Early Cambrian (540Ma) through to just before the final Pangea breakup at 200Ma, which show the distributions of land, shallow and deep shelves, oceans, reefs and other features at nine selected Palaeozoic intervals. The South Pole was within Gondwana and the Gondwanan sector of Pangea for nearly all of the Palaeozoic, and thus the deposition of significant glaciogenic rocks in the brief Late Ordovician (Hirnantian) and the much longer Permo-Carboniferous ice ages help in determining where their ice caps lay, and plotting the evaporites in the superterrane area indicates the positions of the subtropics through time. Reefs are also plotted and selected faunal provinces shown, particularly at times such as the Early Devonian (Emsian), when high climatic gradients are reflected in the provincialisation of shallow-marine benthic faunas, such as brachiopods.In Late Palaeozoic and Early Mesozoic times, Gondwana (with Africa at its core) lay over the African large low shear-wave velocity province (LLSVP), one of two major thermochemical piles covering ca. 10{\%} of the core-mantle boundary. The edges of the LLSVPs (Africa and its Pacific antipode) are the plume generation zones (PGZs) and the source regions of kimberlite intrusions and large igneous provinces (LIPs). Our palaeomagnetic reconstructions constrain the configuration of Gondwana and adjacent continents relative to the spin axis, but in order to relate deep mantle processes to surface processes in a palaeomagnetic reference frame, we have also rotated the PGZs to account for true polar wander. In this way, we visualize how the surface distribution of LIPs and kimberlites relate to Gondwana's passage over the PGZs. There are only two LIPs in the Palaeozoic (510 and 289. Ma) that directly affected Gondwanan continental crust, and kimberlites are rare (83 in total). This is because Gondwana was mostly located between the two LLSVPs. The majority of Palaeozoic kimberlites are Cambrian in age and most were derived from the African PGZ. Sixty-six Early Mesozoic kimberlites are also linked to the African LLSVP. All known LIPs (Kalkarindji, Panjal Traps, Central Atlantic Magmatic Province and Karoo) from 510 to 183. Ma (the lifetime of Gondwana) were derived from plumes associated with the African LLSVP, and three of them probably assisted the breakup of Gondwana and Pangea. ?? 2013 International Association for Gondwana Research.},

This path predicts that EANT was located at tropical to subtropical southerly latitudes from ca. 1 Ga to 420 Ma. Around 400 Ma and again at 320 Ma, EANT underwent southward drift. Ca. 250 Ma Antarctica voyaged briefly north but headed south again ca. 200 Ma. Since 75 Ma EANT became surrounded by spreading centers and has remained extremely stable.

From this history we computed net lithospheric rotation (NR) through time confirming the so-called westward drift, but only for the past 30 Myr. The NR has significantly smaller magnitudes (0.13??/My, past 5 My) than for some other plate models; it averages to 0.11 ?? 0.03??/My for the past 50 My with a small but systematic increase toward the present. The westward drift, seen only for the past 30 My, is attributed to the increased dominance of a steadily growing and accelerating Pacific plate. NR shows peaks with time but only an Early Tertiary peak of 0.33??/My (when the Indian plate was undergoing the largest known acceleration/deceleration) can be interpreted with some confidence. We find a linear decreasing trend in net rotation over the past 150 My, but attribute this trend to increasing reconstruction uncertainties back in time, as subduction consumed more than half of the oceanic crust since the Jurassic. After removing a linear time-trend, we find a NR average of about 0.12??/My for the past 150 My. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This fit is applicable to the Late Cretaceous, directly prior to and during the early phase of Madagascar-India separation. In our Late Cretaceous reconstruction, south-west India runs roughly subparallel with the first known break-up related magnetic anomaly (A34); it maintains a close connection between Mada-gascar and India, but places India slightly rotated compared to the eastern margin of Madagascar and more northerly compared with some reconstructions. St. Mary magmatism is linked to the initial break-up between India and Madagascar, and magmatism probably resulted from rift-related extensional processes initially induced by the Marion hotspot underlying southern Madagascar during the Late Cretaceous.},

The palaeomagnetic data are all of normal magnetic polarity, and remanence acquisition is linked to the terminal stages of the Cretaceous Normal Superchron ($\geq$83 Ma). This is sustained by an 40Ar/39Ar age of 83.6 $\pm$ 1.6 Ma from one of the tested basaltic flows. A precise U/Pb zircon-baddeleyite age from northeast Madagascar demonstrates magmatism at least back to 91.6 $\pm$ 0.3 Ma; thus reliable isotope ages for the Madagascar Cretaceous igneous province span a range of 8 million years. Late Cretaceous palaeomagnetic data obtained from volcanics and dolerites all over Madagascar are directionally concordant, and the combined palaeomagnetic pole (latitude 68.5{$^{\circ}$}N, longitude 230.3{$^{\circ}$}E, A95 = 5.5{$^{\circ}$}, N = 8 studies; sampling age range ca. 84-90 Ma) represents one of the best Late Cretaceous poles for the former Gondwanan elements.

+5.3 for the proposed focal point of the Marion plume (Volcan de l'Androy, southeast Madagascar) during the late Cretaceous.

Following the Silurian Caledonian Orogeny, Laurentia's and Baltica's Apparent Polar Wander Paths (APWPs) can be merged into a Laurussia path, followed in turn by a merger of the Laurussia and Siberia data from latest Permian time onward into a Laurasian combined path. Meanwhile, after about 320 Ma, Gondwana's and Laurussia/Laurasia's path can be combined into what comes steadily closer to the ideal of a Global Apparent Polar Wander Path (GAPWaP) for late Palaeozoic and younger times. Tests for True Polar Wander (TPW) episodes are now feasible since Pangaea fusion and we identify four important episodes of Mesozoic TPW between 250 and 100 Ma.

  abstract     = {Sedimentary basin inversion, the shortening of formerly extensional basins, is accommodated mainly by compressional reactivation of extant faults and fractures across a wide range of scales. As such, inversion is a large-scale manifestation of Byerlee friction, the dynamic criterion for fault reactivation governing the effective shear strength of the shallow crust. Basin inversion generates distinctive deformational architecture, and it is implicated strongly in sedimentary basin exhumation. As a principal source of horizontal stress, inversion drives significant sedimentary porosity reduction and resultant fluid flow. Upper crustal deformation is critically dependent on fluid overpressure (i.e., pore fluid pressures greater than would be calculated from a hydrostatic gradient), and, perhaps more than in any other tectonic setting, overpressures are potentially large during sedimentary basin inversion. This review therefore includes discussion of the role of fluid overpressure in inversion and the evidence for it. Collectively, inversion has profound implications-good and bad-for the prospectivity of many petroliferous sedimentary basins. Thus, recognizing the evidence for basin inversion, quantifying its magnitude and understanding the mechanisms that accommodate inversion and other phenomena affected by it, have become essential components of the basin analyst's remit. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

A reader's comprehension is limited to what the author concludes, without exposure to the computational process. Often, the industrious reader cannot expand upon or validate the author's results. Even the author may struggle to reproduce their own results upon revisiting them. R Markdown is an authoring syntax that combines the ease of Markdown with the statistical programming language R. An R Markdown document or presentation interweaves computation, output and written analysis to the effect of transparency, clarity and an inherent invitation to reproduce (especially as sharing data is now as easy as the click of a button). It is an open-source tool that can be used either on its own or through the RStudio integrated development environment (IDE). In addition to facilitating reproducible research, R Markdown is a boon to collaboratively-minded data analysts, whose workflow can be streamlined by sharing only one master document that contains both code and content. Statistics educators may also find that R Markdown is helpful as a homework template, for both ease-of-use and in discouraging students from copy-and-pasting results from classmates.

  year         = {2003},
  pages        = {49},
  abstract     = {The West Siberian basin is the largest petroleum basin in the world covering an area of about 2.2 million km2. The basin occupies a swampy plain between the Ural Mountains and the Yenisey River. On the north, the basin extends offshore into the southern Kara Sea. On the west, north, and east, the basin is surrounded by the Ural, Yenisey Ridge, and Turukhan-Igarka foldbelts that experienced major deformations during the Hercynian tectonic event and the Novaya Zemlya foldbelt that was deformed in early Cimmerian (Triassic) time. On the south, the folded Caledonian structures of the Central Kazakhstan and Altay-Sayan regions dip northward beneath the basin?s sedimentary cover. The basin is a relatively undeformed Mesozoic sag that overlies the Hercynian accreted terrane and the Early Triassic rift system. The basement is composed of foldbelts that were deformed in Late Carboniferous?Permian time during collision of the Siberian and Kazakhstan continents with the Russian craton. The basement also includes several microcontinental blocks with a relatively undeformed Paleozoic sedimentary sequence. The sedimentary succession of the basin is composed of Middle Triassic through Tertiary clastic rocks. The lower part of this succession is present only in the northern part of the basin; southward, progressively younger strata onlap the basement, so that in the southern areas the basement is overlain by Toarcian and younger rocks. The important stage in tectono-stratigraphic development of the basin was formation of a deep-water sea in Volgian?early Berriasian time. The sea covered more than one million km2 in the central basin area. Highly organic-rich siliceous shales of the Bazhenov Formation were deposited during this time in anoxic conditions on the sea bottom. Rocks of this formation have generated more than 80 percent of West Siberian oil reserves and probably a substantial part of its gas reserves. The deep-water basin was filled by prograding clastic clinoforms during Neocomian time. The clastic material was transported by a system of rivers dominantly from the eastern provenance. Sandstones within the Neocomian clinoforms contain the principal oil reservoirs. The thick continental Aptian?Cenomanian Pokur Formation above the Neocomian sequence contains giant gas reserves in the northern part of the basin. Three total petroleum systems are identified in the West Siberian basin. Volumes of discovered hydrocarbons in these systems are 144 billion barrels of oil and more than 1,300 trillion cubic feet of gas. The assessed mean undiscovered resources are 55.2 billion barrels of oil, 642.9 trillion cubic feet of gas, and 20.5 billion barrels of natural gas liquids. The largest known oil reserves are in the Bazhenov-Neocomian total petroleum system that includes Upper Jurassic and younger rocks of the central and southern parts of the basin. Oil reservoirs are mainly in Neocomian and Upper Jurassic clastic strata. Source rocks are organic-rich siliceous shales of the Bazhenov Formation. Most discovered reserves are in structural traps, but stratigraphic traps in the Neocomian clinoform sequence are pro-ductive and are expected to contain much of the undiscovered resources. Two assessment units are identified in this total petroleum system. The first assessment unit includes all conventional reservoirs in the stratigraphic interval from the Upper Jurassic to the Cenomanian. The second unit includes unconventional (or continuous), self-sourced, fractured reservoirs in the Bazhenov Formation. This unit was not assessed quantitatively. The Togur-Tyumen total petroleum system covers the same geographic area as the Bazhenov-Neocomian system, but it includes older, Lower?Middle Jurassic strata and weathered rocks at the top of the pre-Jurassic sequence. A Callovian regional shale seal of the Abalak and lower Vasyugan Formations separates the two systems. The Togur-Tyumen system is oil-prone; gas reserves are insignificant. The principal o},

  abstract     = {Important environmental parameters in arctic periglacial landscapes (i.e. permafrost temperature, active-layer depth, soil moisture, precipitation, vegetation cover) will very likely change in a warming climate. The thawing of permafrost, especially, might cause massive landscape changes due to thermokarst and an enhanced release of greenhouse gasses from the large amounts of carbon stored in frozen deposits, resulting in positive climate-warming feedback. For the identification, mapping, and quantification of such changes on various scales up to the entire circum-Arctic, remote sensing and spatial data analysis are essential tools. In this study an extensive field-work dataset including spectral surface properties, vegetation, soils, and geomorphology was acquired in the largest Arctic delta formed by a single river, the Siberian Lena River Delta. A portable field spectrometer (ASD FieldSpec Pro FR??) was used for spectral surveys of terrain surfaces, and optical satellite data (Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+), CHRIS-Proba) were used for the characterization, manual mapping, and automatic classification of typical periglacial land-cover units in the Lena Delta. Qualitative data from soils, vegetation, soil moisture, and relief units were correlated with the field-spectral data and catalogued for a wide variety of surface types. The wide range of micro- and meso-scale variations of periglacial surface features in the delta results in distinctive spectral characteristics for different land-cover units. The three main delta terraces could also be spectrally separated and characterized. The present dataset provides a basis for further spectral data acquisitions in the Lena Delta and for comparisons with periglacial surfaces from other regions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Paleoclimate data help to elucidate past and present active mechanisms of climate change by placing the short instrumental record into a longer term context and by permitting models to be tested beyond the limited time that instrumental measurements have been available. Recent observations in the Arctic have identified large ongoing changes and important climate feedback mechanisms that multiply the effects of global-scale climate changes. Ice is especially important in these Arctic amplification processes, which also involve the ocean, the atmosphere, and the land surface (vegetation, soils, and water). As discussed in this report, paleoclimate data show that land and sea ice have grown with cooling temperatures and have shrunk with warming ones, amplifying temperature changes while causing and responding to ecosystem shifts and sea-level changes.},

This challenge aims at disseminating the use of systems that provide reviewers and fellow scientists a convenient way to reproduce computational results of research papers. This can involve among others the calculation of a number, the plotting of a diagram, the automatic proof of a theorem or the interactive transformation of various inputs into a complex output document. Besides reproducing the literate results, readers of an executable paper should also be able to explore the result space by entering different input parameters than the ones reported in the original text. SHARE is a web portal that enables academics to create, share, and access remote virtual machines that can be cited from research papers. By deploying in SHARE a copy of the required operating system as well as all the relevant software and data, authors can make a conventional paper fully reproducible and interactive. Shared virtual machines can also contain the original paper text - when desirable even with embedded computations. This paper shows the concrete potential of SHARE-based articles by means of an example virtual machine that is based on a conventional research article published by Elsevier recently. More generally, it demonstrates how SHARE has supported the publication workflow of a journal special issue and various workshop proceedings. Finally, it clarifies how the SHARE architecture supports among others the Elsevier challenge's licensing and scalability requirements without domain specific restrictions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The sedimentary section can be divided into four major seismic sequences separated by unconformities. The uppermost upper slope deposit is interpreted as a contourite which formed later than the Mid-Miocene by the southerly flow of bottom water along the margin of the SW Norwegian Sea, which is subsequently deflected to the east by the NE Faeroe continental margin and Fugloy Ridge. A scoured channel about 85-90 m deep at about 1000 m water depth associated with the contourite partially follows and modifies a preexisting slump scar. Large-scale slumping and sliding of the middle and lower continental slope below 1500 m water depth have affected sediments of presumably Miocene, Pliocene and Quaternary age. A TOBI deep-tow side-scan sonar mosaic composed of ten lines recorded in 1995 semi-parallel to the slope, shows that mass flow deposits are partially covered by recent contourite sediments on the middle slope. The slump complex at the middle/lower continental slope is younger and has a steep, 250-300 m, irregular, deep main scarp and very large, sometimes rotated blocks near the main scarp. At the base of the slide, numerous 10-15 km long, narrow tracks with individual blocks at the end are found. Several types of debris flows have been mapped, some with a longitudinal flow fabric.},

  abstract     = {We have developed a semi-automated method of determining accurate relative phase arrival times and uncertainty estimates for teleseisms recorded on regional networks. Our analysis begins by obtaining preliminary arrival times with a singletrace phase-picking algorithm. For each possible pair of traces we then perform a search for the maximum of their cross-correlation function in order to obtain relative delay times. Depending on event magnitude, the best results are obtained by using correlation windows containing 2 to 4 sec of the initial energy pulse of the phase. The cross-correlation derived delay times are then used to generate an overdetermined system of linear equations whose solution is an optimized set of relative arrival times. We solve for these times using least squares. Cycle skipping is eliminated through the automatic re-evaluation of cross-correlation functions which yield high equation residuals. Quantitative estimates of timing uncertainty are obtained from the variance of equation residuals associated with each trace. Using data from the Washington Regional Seismograph Network, we have found that for reasonably high-quality events, the rms uncertainty in arrival time estimates is on the order of the sample interval (0.01 sec).

  abstract     = {Glaciated continental shelves are characterised by large amphitheatre-like embayments between prominent cross-shelf troughs. The integration of swath bathymetry and high-resolution seismic data (3D, 2D) collected across the western Svalbard continental margin indicates how such embayments form. Although their bathymetric expression resembles headwall scarps of submarine slope failures, the shelf embayments are the result of the interplay between sediment dynamics and transport underneath fast-moving ice streams in the cross-shelf troughs and the slower-moving parts of the ice sheets on the adjacent shallower shelf banks during full glacial conditions. This is supported by (1) the absence of major landslide deposits at their toe, (2) continuous prograding shelf deposition and (3) absence of landslide-related faulting. Instead, the seismic data suggest a depositional origin of the shelf embayments that is characterised by continuous sediment input at lower rates off a slow-moving ice mass in the centre of the embayment which is fringed by the lateral ice-stream ridges. These findings put into perspective the importance of submarine slope failure on glaciated margins. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the results of a multiproxy investigation including volume magnetic susceptibility (?), mineral and pollen analyses of Late Glacial sediments from Lake Lautrey (Jura, France). Small-scale lithological variations have been identified with high stratigraphic resolution in order to establish lithostratigraphic correlations between cores. ? measurements, combined with mineralogical analyses, provide information on past sedimentary processes. This combined approach reflects major changes in terrestrial habitats and soil processes which may relate to the climatic events characterising the Late Glacial climatic warming and cooling phases. During warm intervals, the record indicates increased lake productivity via carbonate precipitation and decreased input of detrital material. In contrast, cooler intervals show reduced lake productivity, catchment area instability and increased detrital inputs. Several short interruptions in reforestation and in soil stabilisation can be identified and linked with abrupt colder events occurring through the B{\o}lling. A general trend of warming is recorded from the coldest part of the Younger Dryas. Three tephra layers were also detected. The mineral composition analyses show that the upper tephra layer corresponds to the Laacher See eruption (Eifel, Germany) while the lower ones may relate to the volcanic activity of the Cha{\^{i}}ne des Puys (Massif Central, France) around 13 000 cal. yr BP. These two events, recognised for the first time outside the Massif Central region, may provide additional chronostratigraphic markers for the Late Glacial sedimentary records of the Jura mountains and northern Alps.

This supercontinent-triggered superplume mechanism for continental break-up is examined in light of the Mesozoic fragmentation of Pangaea-Gondwana. We summarize the evidence for a superplume event that occurred between 227 and 183 Ma ago, during the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic break-up of Pangaea-Gondwana. The evidence reviewed includes flood magmatism, kimberlite emplacement, plate reorganization and tectonism (including ophiolite obduction events), reversal rate frequency of the geomagnetic field, marine anoxia, deposition of carbon-rich sediments, including oil source rocks and coal, the carbon isotope record, major mass extinctions, and global sea levels. This Late Triassic-Early Jurassic superplume event was comparable in scale with those in the late Proterozoic (c. 800 Ma) and during Cretaceous times (c. 120-80 Ma). Similar to the mid-Cretaceous event, an extended phase of plume magmatism is implicated, with two oceanic and three continental large igneous provinces being emplaced},

This anomaly was originally interpreted as the oldest seafloor-spreading anomaly-A22, revised by Cande and Mutter to A34-in the Southeast Indian Ocean, but is better modelled as the edge effect at the continent-ocean boundary (COB) constrained by seismic data. Continental crust abuts the oceanic sequence of normal and reversed spreading blocks, truncated within the Cretaceous normal interval at an extrapolated age of 96 Ma, rounded to 95 ?? 5 Ma to take into account the uncertainty of the initial spreading rate and of the location of the COB. The occurrence of the anomaly on both margins defines this as the age of breakup. Farther east between 131?? and 139??E on the Australian margin, the COB anomaly is modelled as due to the same kind of effect but with successively younger ages of truncation to 49 Ma, interpreted as indicating the most recent ridge-crest jumping to the Australian COB. The magnetic data from the conjugate sector of Antarctica, albeit scanty, are consistent with this interpretation. The 95 ?? 5 Ma age of breakup coincides with that of the breakup unconformity in southern Australia, expressed by a short mid-Cretaceous lacuna in the Otway Basin between faulted Early Cretaceous rift-valley sediments of the Otway Group and the overlying Late Cretaceous Sherbrook Group, and by an unconformity of similar age in the Great Australian Bight Basin. ?? 1986.},

Another high region in Carboniferous- Permian time was the upland of Europe on crust thickened during the Variscan collision to form Pangea. The ancestral Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains and a central Australian upland may have formed because of long-distance stress from the Variscan collision acting on zones of weak crust attenuated during prolonged subsidence of intracratonic basins. The mid-Carboniferous inception of widespread glaciation was possibly linked with vast uplands in northern and southern Pangea through the effects of Variscan topography and the removal of atmospheric CO2 during accelerated erosion and weathering.},

  abstract     = {On entering an era of global warming, the stability of the Greenland ice sheet (GIS) is an important concern, especially in the light of new evidence of rapidly changing flow and melt conditions at the GIS margins. Studying the response of the GIS to past climatic change may help to advance our understanding of GIS dynamics. The previous interpretation of evidence from stable isotopes (delta(18)O) in water from GIS ice cores was that Holocene climate variability on the GIS differed spatially and that a consistent Holocene climate optimum-the unusually warm period from about 9,000 to 6,000 years ago found in many northern-latitude palaeoclimate records-did not exist. Here we extract both the Greenland Holocene temperature history and the evolution of GIS surface elevation at four GIS locations. We achieve this by comparing delta(18)O from GIS ice cores with delta(18)O from ice cores from small marginal icecaps. Contrary to the earlier interpretation of delta(18)O evidence from ice cores, our new temperature history reveals a pronounced Holocene climatic optimum in Greenland coinciding with maximum thinning near the GIS margins. Our delta(18)O-based results are corroborated by the air content of ice cores, a proxy for surface elevation. State-of-the-art ice sheet models are generally found to be underestimating the extent and changes in GIS elevation and area; our findings may help to improve the ability of models to reproduce the GIS response to Holocene climate.},

  abstract     = {The continental margins surrounding the Norwegian-Greenland Sea are to a large degree shaped by processes during the late Quaternary. The paper gives an overview of the morphology and the processes responsible for the formation of three main groups of morphological features: slides, trough mouth fans and channels. Several large late Quaternary slides have been identified on the eastern Norwegian-Greenland Sea continental margin. The origin of the slides may be due to high sedimentation rates leading to a build-up of excess pore water pressure, perhaps with additional pressure caused by gas bubbles. Triggering might have been prompted by earthquakes or by decomposition of gas hydrates. Trough mouth fans (TMF) are fans at the mouths of transverse troughs on presently or formerly glaciated continental shelves. In the Norwegian-Greenland Sea, seven TMFs have been identified varying in area from 2700 km2 to 215000 km2. The Trough Mouth Fans are depocentres of sediments which have accumulated in front of ice streams draining the large Northwest European ice sheets. The sediments deposited at the shelf break/upper slope by the ice stream were remobilized and transported downslope, mostly as debris flows. The Trough Mouth Fans hold the potential for giving information about the various ice streams feeding them with regard to velocity and ice discharge. Two large deep-sea channel systems have been observed along the Norwegian continental margin, the Lofoten Basin Channel and the Inbis Channel. Along the East Greenland margin, several channel systems have been identified. The deep-sea channels may have been formed by dense water originating from cooling, sea-ice formation and brine rejection close to the glacier margin or they may originate from small slides on the upper slope transforming into debris flows and turbidity currents.},

  abstract     = {The West Siberian Basin is one of the largest intra-cratonic basins of the world and an important hydrocarbon province of Russia. Perhaps the most important geologic event in Siberia was the emplacement of basalts around ???250 Ma (i.e. Permo-Triassic boundary) covering an area of about 5??106 km2. This volcanism may be responsible for a mass extinction that occurred around Permian-Triassic time. The pre-basaltic rifting event was limited to the north-northeastern sector of the basin. Initial basin wide subsidence took place in the Jurassic as a result of which the western part of Siberia became the West Siberian Basin bounded by uplifts to the east and to the west. One of the surprising aspects of the West Siberian Basin is the abundance of sub-vertical faults believed to be result of strike-slip movement. While intra-plate inversions and fault reactivation structures have been observed in many cratons, sub-vertical faults observed in the West Siberian Basin are unique because of their geometries and abundance. The differentiation between the effects of tectonics and eustasy in cratonic basins is simple - the global eustatic signal is basin-wide with regional and local tectonics playing an overprinting role. Thus, the Middle Jurassic-Turonian 1\textsuperscript{st}, 2\textsuperscript{nd}, and 3\textsuperscript{rd} order cycles in the West Siberian Basin were primarily driven by eustasy. The Middle Jurassic-Turonian series can be subdivided into two second-order and 16 third-order transgressive-regressive cycles (within dataset extent). Fourth-order cycles appear to be controlled by delta shifting. Although extensively studied, a number of fundamental questions regarding the origin and evolution of the West Siberian Basin remain unresolved or poorly documented in the literature. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract     = {In order to test the hypothesis that seismic anisotropy in the lowermost mantle is caused by the development of a post-perovskite lattice preferred orientation, and that anisotropy can thus be used as a probe of the dynamics of the mantle's lower boundary layer, an integrated model of texture generation in D$\prime\prime$ is developed. This is used to predict the elastic anisotropy of the lowermost mantle as probed by global anisotropic tomographic inversions. The model combines the current 3D mantle flow field with simulations of the deformation of post-perovskite polycrystalline aggregates. Different descriptions of single crystal plasticity can lead to model results which are anti-correlated to each other. In models where post-perovskite deformation is accommodated by dislocations moving on (010) or (100), patterns of anisotropy are approximately correlated with the results of tomographic inversions. On the other hand, in models where dislocations move on (001) patterns of anisotropy are nearly anti-correlated with tomographic inversions. If all the seismic anisotropy in D$\prime\prime$ extracted from global anisotropic inversions is due to the presence of a lattice preferred orientation in post-perovskite in the lowermost mantle, and if the results of the tomographic inversions are not strongly biased by the sampling geometries, these results suggest that, in contrast to ideas based on the 1D anisotropic signal, deformation of post-perovskite in the lowermost mantle may be accommodated by dislocations moving on (010) or (100). Alternatively, a significant portion of the anisotropic signal may be caused by mechanisms other than the alignment of post-perovskite crystals.},

  abstract     = {The last 6000 years are of particular interest to the understanding of the Earth System because the boundary conditions of the climate system did not change dramatically (in comparison to larger glacial-interglacial changes), and because abundant, detailed regional palaeoclimatic proxy records cover this period. We use selected proxy-based reconstructions of different climate variables, together with state-of-the-art time series of natural forcings (orbital variations, solar activity variations, large tropical volcanic eruptions, land cover and greenhouse gases), underpinned by results from General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs), to establish a comprehensive explanatory framework for climate changes from the Mid-Holocene (MH) to pre-industrial time. The redistribution of solar energy, due to orbital forcing on a millennial timescale, was the cause of a progressive southward shift of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). This was accompanied by a pronounced weakening of the monsoon systems in Africa and Asia and increasing dryness and desertification on both continents. The associated summertime cooling of the NH, combined with changing temperature gradients in the world oceans, likely led to an increasing amplitude of the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and, possibly, increasingly negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices up to the beginning of the last millennium. On decadal to multi-century timescales, a worldwide coincidence between solar irradiance minima, tropical volcanic eruptions and decadal to multi-century scale cooling events was not found. However, reconstructions show that widespread decadal to multi-century scale cooling events, accompanied by advances of mountain glaciers, occurred in the NH (e.g., in Scandinavia and the European Alps). This occurred namely during the Little Ice Age (LIA) between AD $\sim$1350 and 1850, when the lower summer insolation in the NH, due to orbital forcing, coincided with solar activity minima and several strong tropical volcanic eruptions. The role of orbital forcing in the NH cooling, the southward ITCZ shift and the desertification of the Sahara are supported by numerous model simulations. Other simulations have suggested that the fingerprint of solar activity variations should be strongest in the tropics, but there is also evidence that changes in the ocean heat transport took place during the LIA at high northern latitudes, with possible additional implications for climates of the Southern Hemisphere (SH). {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We name the glaciation inferred from the mapped and dated drift the Gladstone. These results are in apparent contrast to the MIS 6 (Illinoian) age of the penultimate Reid glaciation to the east in central Yukon but are equivalent to exposure ages on MIS 4 drift in Alaska. Contrasting penultimate ice extents in Yukon requires that different source areas of the northern CIS in Yukon responded differently to climatic forcing during glaciations. The variation in glacier extent for different source areas likely relates to variation in precipitation during glaciation, as the northern CIS was a precipitation-limited system. Causes for a variation in precipitation remain unclear but likely involve the style of precipitation delivery over the St. Elias Mountains possibly related to variations in the Aleutian low. ?? 2007 University of Washington.},

Model results differ widely. The AMOC slows down considerably (by 20?40{\%}) during the LGM as compared to the modern climate in four models, there is a slight reduction in one model and four models show a substantial increase in AMOC strength (by 10?40{\%}). It is found that a major controlling factor for the AMOC response is the density contrast between Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) at their source regions. Changes in the density contrast are determined by the opposing effects of changes in temperature and salinity, with more saline AABW as compared to NADW consistently found in all models and less cooling of AABW in all models but one. In only two models is the AMOC response during the LGM directly related to the response in net evaporation over the Atlantic basin. Most models show large changes in the ocean freshwater transports into the basin, but this does not seem to affect the AMOC response. Finally, there is some dependence on the accuracy of the control state.},

  abstract     = {Around the Tianchi eruption cone, the Junjianshan Formation which builds the Tianchi basalt shield can be divided into three units. They are, from bottom to top, the Toudao, Baishan and Laofangzixiaoshan units, respectively. Individual basaltic flows of the Tianchi shield vary significantly in volume and in spatial distribution from a few to dozens of kilometers in length, hundreds to thousands of meters in width, and a few to dozens of meters in thickness. K-Ar age data indicate that the Tianchi shield was formed within a very short time period between 2.77 ($\pm$ 0.08) and 0.31 ($\pm$ 0.002) Ma. Our detailed mapping in combination with the K-Ar dating shows that the Toudao unit erupted at $\sim$ 2.77-1.99{~}Ma, the Baishan unit at $\sim$ 1.64-1.11{~}Ma, and the Laofangzixiaoshan at $\sim$ 0.31-0.58{~}Ma. The huge Millennium eruption from the Tianchi Volcano sustained a 35{~}km high column (HT) and lasted a few days, producing the comenditic ignimbrite around the volcano. Wiggle-matching measurements of a sample series of charcoal wood indicate the Millennium eruption might have happened around 1024 AD. Features of eruptions stemming from the same source surrounding the Tianchi Volcano, plus the volcanic evolution from effusive flows to explosive eruption, are interpreted to reflect crustal thickening within this intracontinental tectonic environment. Field observations and lava compositional variations suggest that crystal fractionation and magma mixing or mingling process must have played an important role in the development and evolution of the Tianchi Volcano. {\textcopyright} 2006.},

  abstract     = {In the deep earth, deformation occurs at many scales: large-scale convection produces subduction of slabs and upwelling of plumes in the mantle. At the high temperature/high pressure conditions, strain is accommodated through crystal plasticity, either by diffusion or the movement of dislocations. Slip causes crystal rotations and thus produces a characteristic pattern of crystal preferred orientation and corresponding anisotropy of physical properties at the macroscopic scale. In this study we use polycrystal plasticity, with experimentally derived deformation mechanisms for perovskite, post-perovskite and magnesiowuestite, to predict texture development along streamlines in a 2D geodynamic convection model of the lowermost mantle. Strong preferred orientation develops during subduction and upwelling, while during spreading along the core-mantle boundary the orientation pattern is relatively stable. From preferred crystal orientation and single crystal elastic properties, bulk elastic properties can be calculated and compared with seismic observations. Post-perovskite with predominant (001) slip and magnesiowuestite with {\{}110{\}} and {\{}111{\}} slip produce anisotropy patterns which are consistent with observed anisotropy, i.e. fast S-waves polarized parallel to the core-mantle boundary and anti-correlation between P and S-wave anisotropies. In contrast, perovskite with dominant (001) slip and two post-perovskite models with dominant slip on (010) and (100) produce anisotropy patterns which are inconsistent with seismic observations. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Reid glacial deposits at Ash Bend on the Stewart River are older than oxygen isotope stage (OIS) 6 and likely of OIS 8 age, that is, about 250,000 yr B.P.

  abstract     = {In recent years several tectonic reconstructions have been presented for Australia-Antarctica break-up, with each putting the Australian plate in a different location with respect to Antarctica. These differences reflect the different datasets and techniques employed to create a particular reconstruction. Here we show that some of the more recent reconstructions proposed for Australia-Antarctica break-up are inconsistent with both our current knowledge of margin evolution as well as the inferred match in basement terranes on the two opposing conjugate margins. We also show how these incorrect reconstructions influence the fit of the Indian plate against Antarctica if its movement is tied to the Australian plate. Such errors can have a major influence on the tectonic models of other parts of the world. In this case, we show how the position of the Australia plate can predetermine the extent of Greater India, which is (rightly or wrongly) used by many as a constraint in determining the timing of India-Asia, or India-Island Arc collisions during the closure of Tethys. We also discuss the timing of Australia-Antarctica break-up, and which linear magnetic features are a product of symmetric sea-floor spreading versus those linear magnetic features that result from rifting of a margin. The 46. Ma to 84. Ma rotational poles previously proposed for Australia-Antarctica break-up, and confined to transitional crust and the continent-ocean transition zone, more likely formed during earlier stages of rifting rather than during symmetric sea-floor spreading of oceanic crust. So rotation poles that have been derived from magnetic anomalies in such regions cannot be used as input in a plate reconstruction. A new reconstruction of the Australia-Antarctica margin is therefore proposed that remains faithful to the best available geological and geophysical data. ?? 2013 International Association for Gondwana Research.},

  abstract     = {The kinematics and time-dependence of back-arc extension or compression is one of the most poorly understood aspects of plate tectonics, and has nearly exclusively been studied from snapshots of present-day observations. Here we combine absolute and relative plate motions with reconstructions of now subducted ocean floor to analyse subduction kinematics and upper plate strain from geological observations since 80??Ma along the 3200??km long Sunda-Java trench, one of the largest subduction systems on Earth. Combining plate motions and slab geometries enables us to reconstruct a time-dependent slab window beneath Sundaland, formed through Wharton spreading ridge subduction. We find that upper plate advance and retreat is the main influence on upper plate strain, but subduction of large bathymetric ridges, and slab-window effects, also play a significant, and at times dominant, role. Compression in the Sundaland back-arc region can be linked to advance of the upper plate. Extension of the Sundaland back-arc region correlates with two patterns of upper plate motion, (a) retreat of the upper plate, and (b) advance of the upper plate combined with more rapid advance of the Sundaland margin due to hinge rollback. Subduction of large bathymetric ridges causes compression in the upper plate, especially Wharton Ridge subduction underneath Sumatra over the period 15-0??Ma. Our reconstructions unravel the evolving geometry of a slab window underlying the Java-South Sumatra region, and we propose that decreased mantle wedge viscosities associated with this slab-window exacerbated Palaeogene extension in the Java Sea region via active rifting, and enabled Sumatran continental extension to continue at 50-35??Ma when upper plate advance would otherwise have led to compression. ?? 2007.},

If the cross-over is avoided completely by excluding S data beyond 82 degrees then no resolution is available below 2200 km in the lower mantle. A partial solution is to try to pick up the S phase beyond the cross-over which improves coverage and resolution in depth. However, a much larger improvement can be made by following the first arrival with S character and including SKS information with S. Arrival times for both S and SKS phases and the event hypocentres have been taken from the reprocessing of data reported to international agencies. Each event has been relocated, including depth phase information, and later phases re-associated using the improved locations to provide a set of travel times whose variance is significantly reduced compared with the original data catalogues. S travel-time tomography including SKS information out to 105 degrees, provides tomographic images with improved rendition of heterogeneity in the lower mantle. The three-dimensional models of SV wavespeed relative to the ak135 reference velocity model show a significant increase in heterogeneity at the base of the mantle which marches the behaviour seen in results derived from waveform inversion. For most of the mantle there is a considerable similarity between the patterns of heterogeneity in the S wave images and recent P wave tomographic results, but greater differences develop in the lowermost mantle. In the D " region the SV wavespeed patterns also show some differences from recent SH wavespeed results which mostly correlate with regions of recognised structural complexity.},

We explain these observations by edge-driven convection following rehydration of Colorado Plateau lithosphere. A rapidly emplaced Cenozoic step in lithosphere thickness between the Colorado Plateau and adjacent extended Rio Grande rift and Basin and Range province causes small-scale convection in the asthenosphere. A lithospheric drip below the plateau is removing lithosphere material from the edge that is heated and metasomatized, resulting in magmatism. Edge-driven convection also drives margin uplift, giving the plateau its characteristic bowl shape. The edge-driven convection model shows good consistency with features resolved by seismic tomography.},

The range is located on the tectonic boundary between non-cratonic West and cratonic East Antarctica. Formation of the mountain range and a possible relation with the West Antarctic Rift system are unclear. In this study, we find a new explanation for uplift of the Transantarctic Mountains and suggest a relation between uplift of the range, formation of a small crustal root, depression of the hinterland Wilkes Basin, and the formation of the adjacent West Antarctic Rift system. Numerical models show that upon extension of the Antarctic lithosphere, the West Antarctic Rift system is formed on the tectonic boundary between East and West Antarctica. Convergence of crustal material results in crustal thickening and uplift of the Earth's surface on the cratonic side of this rift zone, and formation of the Transantarctic Mountains. Some models predict a depression in the hinterland of the mountain range at the location of the Wilkes Basin. These models predict that the Wilkes Basin is a non-extensional basin caused by flexure of the lithosphere. This study shows that inherited lithosphere structures play an important role in localization of both extensional and convergent deformation. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.},

During advance, McCarty Glacier shed outwash along the fjord, and into ice-dammed tributaries inundating forests. A radioacarbon framework has revealed at least two major late Holocene glacial advances that occurred following a poorly documented expansion about 3600 BP. These two later advances are resolved within this fjord with tree-ring dating of in situ and transported tree trunks. The first event was an early medieval expansion of the McCarty trunk glacier beyond midfjord about 596 A.D.; this followed an interval of tree growth of at least 206 years. Tributary glaciers probably also advanced at this time. However, continuous tree-growth occurred in the distal (southern) tributary valleys during this advance, while northern tributaries were being dammed by the advancing trunk glacier. The down-valley extent of this expansion is thus constrained to a position within 12 km of the present contracted ice margin. The tree-ring refined chronology shows that a second McCarty ice expansion began in the 9\textsuperscript{th} century, and reached midfjord by 900 A.D., and continued to advance through the Little Ice Age. In contrast, expansions of land-terminating glaciers here began after 1300 A.D. in concert with mountain glaciers worldwide. A log from a diamict cross-dated with a living tree-ring chronology shows that McCarty Glacier was advancing within a kilometer of its Little Ice Age maximum at 1790 A.D. Since about 1905 A.D., dramatic ice retreat has uncovered more than 20 km of McCarty Fjord. ?? 1993.},

The well-developed deep-sea channel systems cross GDF systems and point towards sediment-laden meltwater production. There is no indication for large-scale submarine sliding such as observed on several locations on the Norwegian margin, where deep-sea channels are far less frequent or do not exist whereas seabed erosion, GDF stacking and trough mouth fans dominate. The observed pattern on the East Greenland margin reflects a contrast to the Norwegian margin in paleo ice-stream extent, dynamics and type of sediment delivery. A conceptual model for ice-sheet behaviour on the continental margin of the Greenland Sea has been developed based on the characteristics, distribution and morphology of GDFs and deep-sea channels in four periods at ca 2.5 Ma, 1.5 Ma, 0.2 Ma and 25 ka. We argue that the erosional capabilities of ice streams on the NE Greenland margin indicated by aggradation versus progradation were less then those of the fast flowing ice streams of the Norwegian margin, and that the ice streams in cross-shelf troughs remained probably distal from the shelf break during the Late Weichselian. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract     = {Three distinct, spatially separated crustal terranes have been recognised in the Shackleton Range, East Antarctica: the Southern, Eastern and Northern Terranes. First insights into the origin and evolution of critical units from these terranes could be gained from new lithogeochemical and isotope (Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, Pb-Pb whole rock and Lu-Hf zircon) data. Mafic gneisses from the Southern Terrane provide geochemical evidence for a within-plate, probably back-arc origin of their protoliths. A plume-distal ridge origin in an incipient ocean basin is the favoured interpretation for the emplacement site of these rocks at c. 1850 Ma, which, together with a few ocean island basalts, were subsequently incorporated into an accretionary continental arc/supra-subduction zone tectonic setting. Magmatic underplating resulted in partial melting of the lower crust, which caused high-temperature granulite-facies metamorphism in the Southern Terrane at c. 1710-1680 Ma. Mafic and felsic gneisses there are characterised by isotopically depleted, positive Nd and Hf initials and model ages between 2100 and 2000 Ma. They may be explained as juvenile additions to the crust towards the end of the Palaeoproterozoic. These juvenile rocks occur in a narrow, c. 150 km long E-W trending belt, inferred to trace a suture that is associated with a large Palaeoproterozoic accretionary orogenic system. The Southern Terrane contains many features that are similar to the Australo-Antarctic Mawson Continent and may be its furthermost extension into East Antarctica. The Eastern Terrane is characterised by metagranitoids that formed in a continental volcanic arc setting during a late Mesoproterozoic orogeny at c. 1060 Ma. Subsequently, the rocks experienced high-temperature metamorphism during Pan-African collisional tectonics at 600 Ma. Isotopically depleted zircon grains yielded Hf model ages of 1600-1400 Ma, which are identical to Nd model ages obtained from juvenile metagranitoids. Most likely, these rocks trace the suture related to the amalgamation of the Indo-Antarctic and West Gondwana continental blocks at ???600 Ma. The Eastern Terrane is interpreted as the southernmost extension of the Pan-African Mozambique/Maud Belt in East Antarctica and, based on Hf isotope data, may also represent a link to the Ellsworth-Whitmore Mountains block in West Antarctica and the Namaqua-Natal Province of southern Africa. Geochemical evidence indicates that the majority of the protoliths of the mafic gneisses in the Northern Terrane formed as oceanic island basalts in a within-plate setting. Subsequently the rocks were incorporated into a subduction zone environment and, finally, accreted to a continental margin during Pan-African collisional tectonics. Felsic gneisses there provide evidence for a within-plate and volcanic arc/collisional origin. Emplacement of granitoids occurred at c. 530 Ma and high-temperature, high-pressure metamorphism took place at 510-500 Ma. Enriched Hf and Nd initials and Palaeoproterozoic model ages for most samples indicate that no juvenile material was added to the crust of the Northern Terrane during the Pan-African Orogeny but recycling of older crust or mixing of crustal components of different age must have occurred. Isotopically depleted mafic gneisses, which are spatially associated with eclogite-facies pyroxenites, yielded late Mesoproterozoic Nd model ages. These rocks occur in a narrow, at least 100 km long, E-W trending belt that separates alkaline ocean island metabasalts and within-plate metagranitoids from volcanic arc metabasalts and volcanic arc/syn-collisional metagranitoids in the Northern Terrane. This belt is interpreted to trace the late Neoproterozoic/early Cambrian Pan-African collisional suture between the Australo-Antarctic and the combined Indo-Antarctic/West Gondwana continental blocks that formed during the final amalgamation of Gondwana. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {A comprehensive set of new geochronological data from different parts of the Shackleton Range in East Antarctica, comprising U-Pb single zircon and Th-U-Pb single and multi-grain monazite data, combined with published results, reveal a complex tectono-thermal history of the Shackleton Range. Three distinct, spatially separated terranes or units with different magmatic and metamorphic history are now recognised: (i) the Southern Terrane (Unit I) contains detrital components as old as 2850 Ma, experienced magmatism between 1850 Ma and 1810 Ma and underwent a medium- to high-grade metamorphic event at 1710-1680 Ma and, locally, again at 510 Ma; (ii) the Eastern Terrane (Unit II) occurs in the easternmost part of the Shackleton Range and contains c. 1060 Ma old Grenvillian granitoids, which experienced metamorphism at c. 600 Ma; and (iii) the Northern Terrane (Unit III) is characterised by 530 Ma old granites and diorites, which are hosted within paragneisses as well as mafic and ultramafic rocks. All rocks of Unit III experienced upper amphibolite- to granulite-facies and, locally, eclogite-facies metamorphism at 510-500 Ma. The geologic features of Palaeoproterozoic tectonism in the Southern Terrane are very similar to those of the Australo-Antarctic Mawson Continent. This may indicate that the Mawson Continent extends across the East Antarctic Shield into the Shackleton Range. The 1060 Ma and 600 Ma events in the Eastern Terrane have not been documented for any part of the Shackleton Range before and are correlated with Grenvillian and Pan-African tectonism in Dronning Maud Land. By implication, this suggests that the Pan-African Mozambique/Maud Belt continues into the Shackleton Range. The associated suture is located in the easternmost Shackleton Range and is related to the amalgamation of the Indo-Antarctic plate with West Gondwana. This was followed by further collision of the combined Indo-Antarctic/West Gondwanan block with East Gondwana at approximately 510 Ma in the Northern Terrane. A suture related to this latter collision can be traced in the Northern Shackleton Range and may continue northwards to the S{\o}r Rondane Mountains and the L{\"{u}}tzow Holm Bay area. Our data support the model that East Antarctica finally assembled during the Pan-African orogeny, rather than during earlier Mesoproterozoic events. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract     = {Eolian landforms are widespread alongside proglacial valley-sandurs in West Greenland and comprise low-relief sand sheets, climbing dunes, and upland loess. Sedimentary facies mainly reflect distance to outwash-source zones and the influence of vegetation cover. The sediments show stratification types typical for poorly to moderately vegetated sand-sheets, alternately laminated silt/peat sequences, and unstratified loess. Twenty-five accelerator mass spectrometry 14C dates provide the basis for the chronostratigraphy of the inland eolian deposits. 14C dates from interstratified sand-sheets suggest that the bulk of eolian sands were deposited prior to 3400 cal yr B.P. and after 550 cal yr B.P. This two-phase formation for the inland dunes most likely reflects local changes in proglacial floodplain development and meltwater rerouting associated with a significant recession of the Greenland ice sheet during the mid Holocene climate optimum. Subsequent floodplain regeneration and renewed sand-sheet formation after 550 cal yr B.P. followed when the ice margin readvanced to its present position. In contrast, atmospheric deposition of regionally derived silt in upland peat mires has been continuous since at least 4750 cal yr B.P. Slit influx data demonstrate a strongly episodic history of the intensity of eolian activity over the past five millennia, which tentatively reflects alternating periods of (winter) aridity associated with the variable incursion of maritime air masses over the interior ice-free areas of West Greenland. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

We show that DNA and amino acids from buried organisms can be recovered from the basal sections of deep ice cores, enabling reconstructions of past flora and fauna. We show that high-altitude southern Greenland, currently lying below more than 2 kilometers of ice, was inhabited by a diverse array of conifer trees and insects within the past million years. The results provide direct evidence in support of a forested southern Greenland and suggest that many deep ice cores may contain genetic records of paleoenvironments in their basal sections.},

Details from the side's internal structure give evidence for one main slide event during MIS 3 followed by repeated minor events. The timing coincides with the transition of the Kapp Ekholm Interstadial into Glaciation G of Svalbard (Mangerud et al., 1998) and the buildup phase of the Svalbard-Barents Sea Ice Sheet. Thus the slide occurred during a period of falling sea level, increasing ice volume, and, presumably, increasing glaciotectonic activity. The side's geometry and internal physical appearance point to a tectonically induced partial shelf collapse. Components: 5872 words, 7 figures, 1 table.},

  abstract     = {The sediment sequence from H{\"{a}}sseldala port in southeastern Sweden provides a unique Lateglacial/early Holocene record that contains five different tephra layers. Three of these have been geochemically identified as the Borrobol Tephra, the H{\"{a}}sseldalen Tephra and the 10-ka Askja Tephra. Twenty-eight high-resolution 14C measurements have been obtained and three different age models based on Bayesian statistics are employed to provide age estimates for the five different tephra layers. The chrono- and pollen stratigraphic framework supports the stratigraphic position of the Borrobol Tephra as found in Sweden at the very end of the Older Dryas pollen zone and provides the first age estimates for the Askja and H{\"{a}}sseldalen tephras. Our results, however, highlight the limitations that arise in attempting to establish a robust, chronologically independent lacustrine sequence that can be correlated in great detail to ice core or marine records. Radiocarbon samples are prone to error and sedimentation rates in lake basins may vary considerably due to a number of factors. Any type of valid and {\textquoteleft}realistic' age model, therefore, has to take these limitations into account and needs to include this information in its prior assumptions. As a result, the age ranges for the specific horizons at H{\"{a}}sseldala port are large and calendar year estimates differ according to the assumptions of the age-model. Not only do these results provide a cautionary note for over-dependence on one age-model for the derivation of age estimates for specific horizons, but they also demonstrate that precise correlations to other palaeoarchives to detect leads or lags is problematic. Given the uncertainties associated with establishing age--depth models for sedimentary sequences spanning the Lateglacial period, however, this exercise employing Bayesian probability methods represents the best possible approach and provides the most statistically significant age estimates for the pollen zone boundaries and tephra horizons.

The AMS C-14 dating technique, geochemical, mineral magnetic, micro- and macrofossil analyses were applied to sediments recovered from lake Stevatnet and the results are interpreted in terms of palaeoenvironmental conditions between 9800 and 8300 C-14 BP. After the disappearance of local glaciers before ca 9800 C-14 BP, the lake productivity increased rapidly at the same time as pioneer plant communities developed on soils which gradually became more stable. Insect data indicates that strong seasonal contrasts with mean July temperatures around 9 degrees C and mean January temperatures around -12 degrees C prevailed between 9500 and 8300 C-14 BP. These high summer temperatures, possibly as much as 4-5 degrees C higher than the present, favoured the development of a flora including Dryas and Angelica cf. archangelica. The enhanced freeze/thaw processes led to an increased erosion of minerogenic and organic material. After 8000 C-14 BP the temperatures may have gradually declined. The environmental reconstruction derived from our data set supports the conceptual insolation model which proposes maximum Holocene seasonality for the Northern Hemisphere at ca 9000 C-14 BP.},

We focus on applications of three general techniques: short-lived radioisotopes (210Pb and 137Cs), radiocarbon (14C), and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), which collectively offer the potential for dating sediments ranging from decades to 105 years in age. Our focus is placed on the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques in establishing a chronostratigraphic framework for reconstructing environmental change in high latitude environments, with only brief theoretical and methodological considerations. The underlying principles of each of these methods are covered extensively by complementary reviews in the DPER book series (Appleby 2001; Bj{\"{o}}rck and Wohlfarth 2001; Lian and Huntley 2001), as are additional dating techniques including varved sediments (Lamoureux 2001) and tephrochronology (Turney and Lowe 2001).},

  abstract  = {A 137 cm sediment core from Fog Lake, a small upland basin that was not glaciated during the Late Wisconsinan, reveals the following stratigraphic succession: (I) basal diamicton, (II) laminated silts, (III) compacted dewatered gyttja, (IV) stratified minerogenic sediments, and (V) overlying gyttja. Units I-III, and most of unit IV, were deposited prior to the Holocene; unit V represents approximately the last 8000 14C years. Alternate luminescence dating techniques (TL and IRSL) place unit III in latter oxygen isotope stage (OIS) 5, {\textgreater} 74,000 years BP. A Suite of 20 AMS 14C dates suggests that much of the post-OIS 5 paleoenvironmental record is characterized by either extremely low continuous sediment accumulation, or by one or more episodes of more rapid sedimentation. Diverse pollen and spore assemblages have concentrations that are unexpectedly high throughout the pre-Holocene sediments ( {\textgreater} 10,000 grains cm-3), by comparison to the Holocene (??? 5000 grains cm-3). Exceedingly low sediment accumulation rates appear to have resulted in the concentration of atmospherically derived pollen and spores. Diatom assemblages record the evolution of the lake's chemistry and past algal production. Several abrupt changes occurred synchronously in both the terrestrial and aquatic components of the system, and these appear to represent ecological responses to pre-Holocene climatic variability. The sediments of Fog Lake provide the first integrated paleoecological record older than Holocene for a vast region of the Canadian Arctic, thereby refining our understanding of long-term arctic ecosystem ontogeny. ?? 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract     = {Rapid stratigraphic changes are recorded in recent assemblages of subfossil Chrysophyceae from the sediments of two highly contrasted arctic lakes, one situated in the polar desert of west-central Ellesmere Island, and the other on eastern Baffin Island in the mid-Arctic climatic zone. In Sawtooth Lake on the Fosheim Peninsula, concentrations of chrysophycean stomatocysts increase dramatically in sediments deposited since AD 1920. Only trace abundances of stomatocysts are encountered in older sediments. In Kekerturnak Lake, on the north coast of Cumberland Peninsula, scales of Mallomonas spp., previously absent from the sediment record, appear suddenly in the upper 5.5 cm of sediment and subsequently become ubiquitous in the top 1.0 cm. These results corroborate diatom stratigraphic data from other sites in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, together suggesting that unprecedented ecological changes are presently occurring across this vast region. In all likelihood, these abrupt algal community shifts reflect the response of arctic lake ecosystems to well-documented climate warming since the Little Ice Age, with the implications that recent rates of environmental change are unprecedented in the context of the Holocene.},

Low velocities continue downward to the mantle transition zone between 410 and 660. km depth and extend into the topmost lower mantle, although the resolution of lower mantle structure from this data set is limited. Comparisons of inversions with separate data sets at different frequencies suggest that contamination by water reverberations is not markedly biasing the P-wave imaging of mantle structure. Many aspects of the P-wave images are consistent with independent tomographic images of S-wave velocity in the region, but there are some differences in upper mantle structure between P-wave and S-wave velocities. Inversions without station terms show a southwestward shift in the location of lowest P-wave velocities in the uppermost mantle relative to the pattern for shear waves, and inversions with station terms show differences between P-wave and S-wave velocity heterogeneity in the shallow upper mantle beneath and immediately east of the island of Hawaii. Nonetheless, the combined data sets are in general agreement with the hypothesis that the Hawaiian hotspot is the result of an upwelling, high-temperature plume. The broad upper-mantle low-velocity region beneath the Hawaiian Islands may reflect the diverging "pancake" at the top of the upwelling zone; the surrounding region of high velocities could represent a downwelling curtain; and the low-velocity anomalies southeast of Hawaii in the transition zone and topmost lower mantle are consistent with predictions of plume tilt. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract     = {Lithospheric extension in the West Antarctic Rift System and the Ross Sea embayment is related to Cenozoic alkaline volcanism. Basanites and alkali basalts define the two endmembers of primary magmas with distinct petrographic, chemical and isotopic compositions. Basanites are generally more primitive and significantly more enriched in incompatible trace elements than alkali basalts. Parallel incompatible trace-element distribution patterns in both rock types but slightly different isotopic compositions suggest a derivation by different degrees of partial melting from different mantle sources. Sr-, Nd- and Pb-isotopes allow the identification of distinct magma sources: asthenospheric mantle, enriched lithospheric mantle and a HIMU plume component which is widespread beneath the entire area. Spatial and temporal variations in isotopic compositions suggest a relationship between the dynamics of lithospheric extension and changing mantle sources of related magmas. Geothermobarometry on mantle xenoliths documents a pressure-temperature-time evolution of the mantle lithosphere which is related to rifting, uplift and cooling of mantle below the Ross Sea Rift-Transantarctic Mountain transition.

A growing net of coverage by seismic data, almost 70 deep hydrocarbon exploration wells and a series of shallow coring programmes, have contributed greatly to our understanding of this province, supplementing information from neighbouring land areas. The late Paleozoic to present-day development of the region can be described in terms of five major depositional phases. These partly reflect the continuing northwards movement of this segment of the Eurasian plate from the equatorial zone in the mid-Devonianearly Carboniferous up to its present-day High Arctic latitudes, resulting in significant climatic changes through time. Important controls on sedimentation have involved varying tectonic processes along the eastern, northern and western margins of the shelf, whereas short- and long-term local and regional sea-level variations have further determined the depositional history of the province.},

In this paper, the gravitationally self-consistent Sea-level Equation is solved by the Coupled Laplace-Finite Element method for a spherical, self-gravitating incompressible Maxwell earth. Relative sea-level (RSL) rate, land uplift rate, tangential velocity and rate of change of geoid height are computed for earth models with lateral heterogeneities - including lithospheric thickness, asthenosphenc and lower mantle viscosity variations. One purpose is to see if these rate-related observations can resolve the lateral structures. Another purpose is to determine the optimal location where such observations can be used to resolve such lateral structures. All these rate-related observations are found to be capable of detecting lateral viscosity contrasts in the lower mantle underneath the load. However, geoidal rates are not very useful in detecting lateral variations in lithospheric thickness and asthenospheric viscosity but tangential velocity is robust in distinguishing such lateral heterogeneity. Combined lateral variations in lithospheric thickness and asthenospheric viscosity can be detected by RSL data near the ice margin and land uplift rate or RSL rate data near the center of rebound. For lateral variations involving lithospheric thickness alone, the optimal place for detection is near the ice margin for RSL, land uplift rate and RSL rate. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This discontinuity is seen in many regions around the world, both with P and S waves. The D$\prime\prime$ discontinuity has a mean apparent depth of about 250--265 km for both P and S waves. While many more non-observations (where no discontinuity is observable above the seismic noise levels) exist for P waves than for S waves, both P and S non-observations and observations are distributed with little obvious geographical coherence. The O$\prime\prime$ discontinuity is often modeled as a precipitous increase in seismic velocity of about 2.5--3.0{\%}, though most data can accommodate a transition width of up to 50 or 75 km. The D$\prime\prime$ discontinuity is usually modeled with lower than average velocities above the discontinuity, but the velocity gradient beneath the discontinuity has been modeled with negative, positive, or zero velocity gradients. There is a strong indication that the base of D$\prime\prime$ displays a strong decrease in seismic velocities. There is no significant correlation between large scale seismic velocities at the base of the mantle and (1) the occurrence or absence of a D$\prime\prime$ discontinuity, or (2) a variation in the thickness of the observed depth of the discontinuity. Available seismic evidence leaves several possibilities open for D$\prime\prime$ discontinuity origins. Ponding of the remnants of subducted slabs may provide a large enough decrease in temperature to generate a 3{\%} velocity increase. A mineralogical phase change in a major silicate constituent, perhaps caused by thermal or chemical anomalies, might provide a significant velocity increase. In both cases, a mechanism must exist to cause significant topography on the discontinuity. A third possibility is of significant heterogeneity, either as a stable chemical boundary layer or in the form of laminar layers (perhaps from core-mantle reactions or of ancient ocean crust) that are scattered about the base of the mantle.},

We obtained a total of 109 high-quality measurements of PKP(BC)-PKP(DF) differential traveltimes by waveform cross-correlations from earthquakes spanning over 30 years. The results show robust temporal changes in PKP(BC)-PKP(DF) residuals along this pathway, providing new support for the differential inner core hypothesis. We also observed evidence for a lateral velocity gradient in this part of the inner core. Assuming that the temporal changes result from a shift of a lateral structure due to an inner core rotation, we estimate the inner core rotation rate to be about 0.41 $\pm$ 0.12{$^{\circ}$} yr$-$1 faster than the mantle.},

  abstract     = {The fate of subducted oceanic slabs can provide important clues to plate reconstruction through Earth history. Since oceanic slabs in continental collision zones are typically not well preserved, ancient subduction zones have rarely been imaged by geophysical techniques. Here we present an exception from the Darbut belt in the Junggar accretionary collage in the southern Altaids of Asia. We deployed a 182 km long magnetotelluric (MT) profile including 60 broadband sounding sites across the belt. Quality off-diagonal impedances were inverted by a three-dimensional scheme to image resistivities beneath the profile. The resistivity model along with MT impedance phase ellipses and induction vectors were tested and interpreted in detail. Combining geological and geophysical observations, mineral physical experiment, and geodynamic modeling results, the MT transect suggests a fossil intraoceanic subduction zone during the Late Paleozoic in the western Junggar that has been well preserved due to lack of significant subsequent tecto-thermal events.},

  abstract     = {The chronologies of five northern European ombrotrophic peat bogs subjected to a large AMS 14C dating effort (32-44 dates/site) are presented here. The results of Bayesian calibration (BCal) of dates with a prior assumption of chronological ordering were compared with a Bayesian wiggle-match approach (Bpeat) which assumes constant linear accumulation over sections of the peat profile. Interpolation of BCal age estimates of dense sequences of 14C dates showed variable patterns of peat accumulation with time, with changes in accumulation occurring at intervals ranging from 20 to 50 cm. Within these intervals, peat accumulation appeared to be relatively linear. Close analysis suggests that some of the inferred variations in accumulation rate were related to the plant macrofossil composition of the peat. The wiggle-matched age-depth models had relatively high chronological uncertainty within intervals of closely spaced 14C dates, suggesting that the premise of constant linear accumulation over large sections of the peat profile is unrealistic. Age models based on the assumption of linear accumulation over large parts of a peat core (and therefore only effective over millennial time-scales), are not compatible with studies examining environmental change during the Holocene, where variability often occurs at decadal to centennial time-scales. Ideally, future wiggle-match age models should be constrained, with boundaries between sections based on the plant macrofossil composition of the peat and physical-chemical parameters such as the degree of decomposition. Strategies for the selection of material for dating should be designed so that there should be enough 14C dates to accurately reconstruct the peat accumulation rate of each homogeneous stratigraphic unit. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This evolution includes gradual trends of warming and cooling driven by tectonic processes on time scales of 10(5) to 10(7) years, rhythmic or periodic cycles driven by orbital processes with 10(4)- to 10(6)-year cyclicity, and rare rapid aberrant shifts and extreme climate transients with durations of 10(3) to 10(5) years. Here, recent progress in defining the evolution of global climate over the Cenozoic Era is reviewed. We focus primarily on the periodic and anomalous components of variability over the early portion of this era, as constrained by the latest generation of deep-sea isotope records. We also consider how this improved perspective has led to the recognition of previously unforeseen mechanisms for altering climate.},

  abstract     = {The existence of a pre-Rodinia Precambrian supercontinent, variously called Nuna or Columbia, has been widely speculated in the past decade, but the precise timing of its existence and its configuration have been uncertain due to the lack of unequivocal paleomagnetic and geological constraints. Here we report high-quality paleomagnetic results from the well dated {\~{}}1780Ma Xiong'er Group in southern North China Block (NCB). A total of 110 paleomagnetic samples from 14 sites were collected and subjected to stepwise thermal demagnetization. After removing a low temperature component (CL) of viscous magnetic remanence acquired in recent geomagnetic field, a high temperature component (CH), carried by hematite and magnetite in redbeds and volcanic samples, has been isolated. It gives a mean direction of (D=18.4??, I=-3.7??, ?? 95=7.6??, N=14) after bedding correction, and a corresponding paleomagnetic pole at 50.2??N, 263.0??E (A 95=4.5??). The CH passed a reversal test and was interpreted as a primary remanence. This new pole plus three other high-quality poles from the NCB that have been more precisely dated at 1769??3Ma, 1560-1440Ma and 1437??21Ma define a 1780-1440Ma apparent polar wander path (APWP) for the NCB. This, together with an update of global high quality paleomagnetic dataset, allows us to demonstrate that the pre-Rodinia supercontinent Nuna likely existed at least between {\~{}}1780Ma and {\~{}}1400Ma. Our paleomagnetism-based global reconstruction, for the first time, quantitatively assembles all major cratons together; it encompasses previously proposed regional links including the SAMBA connection between Baltica, Amazonia and Western Africa (Johansson, 2009), connections between Laurentia, Baltica and Siberia at the core of Nuna (Evans and Mitchell, 2011), the proto-SWEAT connection between Laurentia, East Antarctica and Australian blocks (Payne et al., 2009), and the NCB-India connection (Zhao et al., 2011). ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

It is discovered from the formula that the theoretical limit of the SEG Y file compression ratio is the quotient of the SEG Y header data compression ratio divided by the header ratio, therefore, it is necessary to compress the header data efficiently in order to get a high compression of the SEG Y file. Furthermore, the statistical properties of the SEG Y reel header data and trace header data are analyzed. An efficient lossless compression method for SEG Y header data, known as Header Identification Data Lossless Prediction Coding (HIDLPC) method, is proposed based on the statistical properties of the SEGY header data. Experimental results show that the lossless compression ratio by using HIDLPC to compress SEG Y header data locates between 30 and 1000, much higher than the corresponding compression ratios by using Winzip and WinRAR.},
